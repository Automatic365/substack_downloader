Most teams end up in this situation: ship a feature to 10% of users, wait a week, check three different tools, try to correlate the data, and you’re still unsure if it worked. The problem is that each tool has its own user identification and segmentation logic. Statsig solved this problem by building everything within a unified platform. <a href="http://statsig.com/pragmatic">Check out Statsig.</a></p><p>•⁠ <strong><a href="https://linear.app/pragmatic?utm_source=gergely&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=pragmatic-engineer">Linear</a></strong> – The system for modern product development. In the episode, Armin talks about how he uses an army of “AI interns” at his startup. With Linear, you can easily do the same: Linear’s Cursor integration lets you add Cursor as an agent to your workspace. This agent then works alongside you and your team to make code changes or answer questions. You’ve got to try it out: <a href="https://linear.app/pragmatic?utm_source=gergely&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=pragmatic-engineer">give Linear a spin</a> and see how it integrates with Cursor.</p><p>—</p><h3><strong>In this episode</strong></h3><p>For an AI startup today, what language would be the best choice: Python, TypeScript, Go or Rust? </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arminronacher/">Armin Ronacher</a></strong> is the creator of the <strong>Flask</strong> framework for <strong>Python</strong>, was one of the first engineers hired at <strong>Sentry</strong>, and now the co-founder of a new startup. He has spent his career thinking deeply about how tools shape the way we build software.</p><p>In this episode of <em>The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast</em>, he joins me to talk about how programming languages compare, why Rust may not be ideal for early-stage startups, and how AI tools are transforming the way engineers work. Armin shares his view on what continues to make certain languages worth learning, and how agentic coding is driving people to work more, sometimes to their own detriment.</p><p>We also discuss:</p><ul><li><p>Why the Python 2 to 3 migration was more challenging than expected</p></li><li><p>How Python, Go, Rust, and TypeScript stack up for different kinds of work</p></li><li><p>How AI tools are changing the need for unified codebases</p></li><li><p>What Armin learned about error handling from his time at Sentry</p></li><li><p>And much more</p></li></ul><p><strong>Jump to interesting parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=413s">06:53</a>. — How Python, Go, and Rust stack up and when to use each one</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=1808s">30:08</a> — Why Armin has changed his mind about AI tools</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=3032s">50:32</a> — How important are language choices from an error-handling perspective?</p></li></ul><div class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs='{"videoId":"45kVol96IlM","startTime":null,"endTime":null}' data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM" id="youtube2-45kVol96IlM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="409" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/45kVol96IlM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" width="728"></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>Interesting quotes from the episode</strong></h3><p>On how Armin uses AI tools (<a href="https://youtu.be/45kVol96IlM?si=qsueCtgWRQ6nAgNj&amp;t=1685">at 28:05</a>)</p><blockquote><p>“Over the years, many of my projects didn’t go anywhere because the legwork needed to build this bespoke tooling to be able to pull this project off was too much.</p><p><strong>One of the big changes I’m noticing for myself is that I have so many better tools around now.</strong> For example, I moved from Terraform to Pulumi for one of the services just to see how that goes. I had Claude build me a perfect control system to get my logs and visualize what’s going on in production. I would never have done this before [Claude Code] just because it wouldn’t have worked.”</p></blockquote><p>Why Armin wants to hire more engineers at his startup, despite using an “army of AI interns” until now (<a href="https://youtu.be/45kVol96IlM?si=aQdE-iFTvN1YafU9&amp;t=2028">at 33:48</a>:)</p><blockquote><p>Now there’s an argument to be made that maybe systems like Claude will help you, and maybe you can even bootstrap a startup around it. But if you fully delegate everything that you’re doing to a machine, then the person who doesn’t do that has an edge on you. </p><p><strong>This is one of the reasons I want to hire more people now.</strong> It’s just because Claude is not a human. There’s energy to a well-running company and to motivated people that just a computer can’t replace. So a big part that sticks with you as an engineer is understanding how to create your systems, and understanding when the code it produces is more right versus more wrong. I don’t think much of this has changed [since AI].</p></blockquote><p>Why Armin doesn’t believe strongly typed languages like TypeScript meaningfully reduce errors — based on his experience observing this at Sentry (<a href="https://youtu.be/45kVol96IlM?si=dCLf_qqIjk3rL3cf&amp;t=3174">at 52:42</a>:)</p><blockquote><p>There was a large-scale realization in JavaScript ecosystem that type checkers could get rid of a whole class of errors, because at the very least you have to explicitly check if this thing is nullable or not.</p><p><strong>I never got the feeling that the adoption of TypeScript dramatically changed anything about JavaScript error rates.</strong> None of that adoption had any meaningful impact. If there was an impact, it’s immeasurable.</p><p>I remember that the adoption of more and more complex things in the React ecosystem has just dramatically increased the types of errors. For example, hydration errors were not a thing for many years. And then all of sudden, there’s a whole class of new errors coming in because of this [because of the wider adoption of React.]</p></blockquote><p></p><h3><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-claude-code-is-built">How Claude Code is built </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cursor">Real-world engineering challenges: building Cursor</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world">AI Engineering in the real world </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack">The AI engineering stack </a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a founding engineer: lessons from the trenches</a></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Timestamps</strong></h3><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=94s">01:34</a>) Why the Python 2 to 3 migration created so many challenges</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=413s">06:53</a>) How Python, Go, and Rust stack up and when to use each one</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=515s">08:35</a>) The friction points that make Rust a bad fit for startups</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=748s">12:28</a>) How Armin thinks about choosing a language for building a startup</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=1353s">22:33</a>) How AI is impacting the need for unified code bases</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=1459s">24:19</a>) The use cases where AI coding tools excel</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=1808s">30:08</a>) Why Armin has changed his mind about AI tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=2284s">38:04</a>) Why different programming languages still matter but may not in an AI-driven future</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=2533s">42:13</a>) Why agentic coding is driving people to work more and why that’s not always good</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=2861s">47:41</a>) Armin’s error-handling takeaways from working at Sentry</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=3032s">50:32</a>) How important is language choice from an error-handling perspective</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=3362s">56:02</a>) Why the current SDLC still doesn’t prioritize error handling</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=3858s">1:04:18</a>) The challenges language designers face</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=3940s">1:05:40</a>) What Armin learned from working in startups and who thrives in that environment</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kVol96IlM&amp;t=4299s">1:11:39</a>) Rapid fire round</p><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><p><strong>Where to find Armin Ronacher:</strong></p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko">https://x.com/mitsuhiko</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arminronacher/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/arminronacher/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://mitsuhiko.at/">https://mitsuhiko.at/</a></p><p>• Blog: <a href="https://lucumr.poco">https://lucumr.poco</a></p><p><strong>Mentions during the episode:</strong></p><p>• Flask: <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/</a></p><p>• Sentry: <a href="https://sentry.io/">https://sentry.io/</a></p><p>• Python: The Documentary: </p><div class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs='{"videoId":"GfH4QL4VqJ0","startTime":null,"endTime":null}' data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM" id="youtube2-GfH4QL4VqJ0"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe allow="autoplay;

            <p><em>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of senior engineers and engineering leaders. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about"> subscribe here</a>.</em></p><p><em>Many subscribers expense this newsletter to their learning and development budget.

Previous articles in this mini-series about the results of that survey have focused on AI-related tools, IDEs, and CI/CD <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey">in Part 1</a>, while <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey-part-2">Part 2</a> covered project management, collaboration tools, databases, and backend-related tools.</p><p>In the third and final part of this dive into the feedback, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Observability, monitoring, and logging.</strong> Grafana, Datadog, and Sentry all stand out, with a long list of open source tools and vendors offering observability platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oncall tooling and incident management. </strong>PagerDuty and OpsGenie remain the most-used solutions, but young startups like incident.io, Rootly, and FireHydrant are challenging them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature flags, analytics, and experimentation.</strong> LaunchDarkly is the most-used solution, with a long tail of analytics, experimentation, and feature flag vendors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frontend and mobile tooling. </strong>React is the most popular frontend framework, and Next.js is the most popular “meta frontend framework”. React Native is the most-mentioned cross-platform mobile framework. In these categories, it’s not even a contest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Developer tools. </strong>Postman is popular for API development, Sonar for static analysis, and Backstage for developer portals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Custom-built tools. </strong>Feature flagging, A/B testing, and CI/CD systems are the most common reasons to build custom tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Niche tools readers love. </strong>Lesser mentioned tools that are highly rated by readers, like Tuple (remote pair programming), Tmux (terminal multiplexer), Ansible (infrastructure automation), and many others.</p></li></ol><p>As mentioned, check out more on the latest survey results in other articles, including:</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey">Part 1:</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Demographics</p></li><li><p>AI tools</p></li><li><p>Most used, most-loved programming languages</p></li><li><p>Most hated (and loved) tools</p></li><li><p>IDEs and terminals</p></li><li><p>Version control and CI/CD</p></li><li><p>Cloud providers, IaaS, and PaaS</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey-part-2">Part 2:</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Most-mentioned tools</p></li><li><p>Project management</p></li><li><p>Communication and collaboration</p></li><li><p>Databases and data stores</p></li><li><p>Backend infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Load balancers</p></li><li><p>Forks of popular open-source projects</p></li></ul><h2>1. Observability, monitoring, and logging</h2><p>The leading observability vendor in this space, Datadog, was founded in 2010 with a focus on server and infrastructure monitoring: collecting metrics from servers, cloud instances, and with AWS as a focal point. Since then, Datadog has continued adding new products, and now supports dozens of features from APM (Application Performance Monitoring – distributed tracing, service maps), through RUM (Real User Monitoring – frontend performance, user sessions), to CI/CD visibility (pipeline monitoring, test analytics), and dozens more products. Datadog lists more than 50 on its website, and most are integrated to work together.</p><p>Other platforms are similar: they started with a narrow focus, added more capabilities, and became the full-blown platforms of today. A good example is Sentry: it started in 2008 as an open source monitoring tool for the Django platform in Python, then got incorporated in 2015 as a company, and today has products for APM (Application Performance Monitoring), error monitoring, session replay, and more.</p><p>With the caveat that comparing vendors in this crowded space is no simple task, below are listed the most-mentioned observability platforms by 3,000 respondents.

Of course, <em>maintaining</em> such systems is where things get tricky, but large-enough companies can have a platform team own it.</p></li><li><p><strong>A/B testing and experimentation.</strong> Another common mention. Integrating A/B testing into internal systems – such as tools for the data team to analyze results, or to integrate with the feature flag system – is a common reason to build in-house.</p></li><li><p><strong>CI/CD systems</strong>. Using custom continuous integration / continuous deployment systems is common enough, although it’s more common to integrate software like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> and run it on existing infrastructure, instead of building “truly” custom software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Logging systems</strong>: another pretty common mention. As with feature flags, it’s easy enough to write your own – at least in the beginning.</p></li></ul><h2>7. Niche tools readers love</h2><p>To close, let’s spotlight some lesser-mentioned tools that some respondents say they love. Why not consider giving them a spin when facing a problem they might solve?</p><p><strong><a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a>:</strong> remote pair programming app</p><blockquote><p>“Tuple is amazing! I work fully remotely and my team pair on everything, so good tooling for remote pairing is essential. The video quality is great, I never have problems with screen resolution (which I do when sharing my large monitor on Google Meet, when my colleague is viewing on a laptop screen). It’s easy to point at things, annotate your pair’s screen, and even take control when you need to”. – Senior engineer at a mid-sized company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introduction-tmux-linux">Tmux</a>: </strong>a terminal multiplexer</p><blockquote><p>“Tmux makes my work extremely efficient. I want to fire up a server, open a new window or a pane, query my database, and open a new pane. I can do whatever I want without moving my eyes from the screen and my hands from the keyboard”. – Senior engineer at a startup.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative">Ansible</a></strong>: infrastructure automation</p><blockquote><p>“Ansible lets me ‘do stuff’ to multiple hosts all at once. It’s great!” – Senior security engineer at a large company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph</a></strong>: code search</p><blockquote><p>“It makes it so easy and intuitive to find relevant examples or check on usage of code, especially because of our heavily distributed codebase with thousands of repos and microservices” – Software engineer at a large publicly traded company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a></strong>: a Kubernetes-native workflow orchestration engine</p><blockquote><p>“I love <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/">Argo Workflows</a>, because it is a Kubernetes-native orchestration engine. This means it is lightweight and allows easy use of other Kubernetes tools without ‘hacking’ the solution”. – Tech lead at a small company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a></strong>: a file/folder difference comparison tool:</p><blockquote><p>“It does its job so well and intuitively that it is one of the first tools after the code editor I install on any new PC I use”. – VP of Engineering at a large company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></strong>: a note-taking app:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s so flexible and powerful: it’s like coding but for notes”. – Senior frontend engineer at a small business.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a></strong>: data orchestration:</p><blockquote><p>“It understands that data is declarative by nature. A really awesome and new approach to data orchestration”. – Engineering manager at a quant fund.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a></strong>: sketching diagrams:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m personally a big fan of Excalidraw, it does one thing and does it really well”. – Tech lead at a startup.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.doppler.com/">Doppler</a></strong>: secrets management</p><blockquote><p>“A fantastic secrets manager. It gets rave reviews from our team!” – Director of engineering at a publicly-traded health &amp; fitness company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a></strong>: a programming language:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s simple, clean, productive, and doesn’t break every other day with new updates”. – Senior engineer at a startup.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a></strong>: an email tool:</p><blockquote><p>“Sadly, I get too many emails, but Superhuman helps me a lot to tame my inbox. UX is incredible – if you like using a keyboard”. Engineering lead at a startup.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a></strong>: a blazing fast package manager for Python, written in Rust:</p><blockquote><p>“uv has come out of nowhere and it has made Python version management and dependency management a breeze”. – VP of engineering at a small company.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a></strong>: a terminal with AI integrations:</p><blockquote><p>“Its built-in AI is irreplaceable for me now, lots of UX delights”. – Staff Engineer at a large tech company.</p></blockquote><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>I hope you’ve found this article and the two others in this mini-series about our survey results useful. What stands out for me in this final set of responses is:</p><p><strong>Observability and logging are tough problems. </strong>Leading vendors offer a large number of products that integrate with each other, but open source products for personally building and operating an observability stack are equally popular.</p><p>Of course, there is no single ideal solution: every team needs to figure out which tools work <em>well enough</em> for them.</p><p><strong>I sense less innovation in frontend and mobile these days. </strong>React is as popular as ever, and Angular and Vue are the stable next choices for a minority of developers. Across Android and iOS, the most popular frameworks mentioned were released in 2019 (SwiftUI for iOS, Jetpack Compose for Android).</p><p><strong>Developer portals’ momentum seems to have stalled. </strong>Backstage was mentioned by 1 in 60 respondents, suggesting most companies don’t have service discoverability issues, or they solve it with internal, custom tools.</p><p><strong>As developers, we can (and do!) build custom tools to solve problems. </strong>I really enjoyed learning from readers about their custom, internal tools built for problems like feature flagging, CI/CD, and others. Some tech leaders and executives might argue that building in-house is not a great tradeoff, and ask why not just buy solutions from vendors.</p><p>But at the end of the day, we’re engineers.</p><p>Sometimes, when a good-enough solution isn’t available, we are more than capable of building our own! If we always defaulted to choosing a vendor, we’d miss out on the pleasure of sharpening our skill at building from scratch.</p><p><em>Thanks again to everyone who filled out this year’s survey about tech stacks.

        <h2 class="post-title">What is good software architecture?</h2>
        <span class="post-date">October 21, 2025</span>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>To try and answer this seemingly basic question, I turned to software engineering veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhawthorne/">Matthew Hawthorne</a>. He’s worked as a software engineer for more than 25 years, and is the author of the upcoming book <a href="https://pushtoprodordietrying.com/">Push to Prod or Die Trying</a>, which shares lessons from the trenches on software, architecture, and pushing to production. It is in early release now and due to be published next year.</p><p>Matt has worked at Comcast, Twitter, and Netflix, where he stayed for 6 years during the 2010s. During his time at Netflix, every engineer made architectural decisions day-to-day and shipped features frequently, which rolled out to tens of millions of users – all without a single mention of the job title “Architect”.</p><p>In this issue, Matt covers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Architects are not the solution to architectural problems. </strong>For a long time, there were no Architects at Netflix, yet the foundations of the architecture were still sound.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trading off today’s problems for tomorrow’s: migrating to AWS. </strong>Moving to the AWS cloud created plenty of problems for Netflix which took serious effort to resolve, down the line. But it also fixed existing pain points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good characteristics of architecture</strong>. These balance practical and aspirational concerns, unify people as well as systems – and are unrelated to good code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bad architecture is a lot of work that doesn’t change much. </strong>It’s like rearranging the furniture in a house that should be demolished and replaced by an improved layout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good architectural trades in Netflix projects. </strong>Making unusual tradeoffs, building tooling to reduce operational work, trading off one set of limitations for another, and upgrading systems to work better in the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to improve your architecture skills. </strong>Design systems based on what could break, know your audience, focus on the right details, and make yourself valuable across several roles.</p></li></ol><p>If you’d like to keep up with Matt’s writing, subscribe to his newsletter, <a href="https://pushtoprod.substack.com/">Push to Prod</a>. You can also purchase his work-in-progress book <a href="https://pushtoprodordietrying.com/">Push to Prod or Die Trying</a>, which is currently 40% complete.</p><p>With that, it’s over to Matt:</p><div><hr/></div><p>At Netflix, we preferred building prototypes to writing formal architecture proposals, while at other companies, I’ve seen impractical architecture proposals fail, overly practical architectural efforts succeed – but then deliver limited impact – and other proposals gather dust due to the absence of the conversations and alignment work necessary for creating a shared plan.</p><p>I’ve always found the work defined by the phrase <em>software architecture</em> to be vague, and the value delivered by capital “A” <em>Architects</em> to be debatable. I speak from personal experience here after my own brief, unimpressive tenure as a “domain architect” – an experience from which I learned much, but delivered very little. Over time, if there’s one thing I’ve learned about architecture, it is that:</p><p><strong>Good architecture work is about purposefully trading problems you have today, for better problems tomorrow.</strong> Basically, if you’re not upgrading your problems, you’re just rearranging furniture.</p><h2>1. Architects are not the solution to architectural problems</h2><p>I worked at Netflix for 6 years and during that time, there were hundreds of things that made the company unique. One was the lack of software architects – in title – at least. In fact, we didn’t have engineering levels at all; every engineer was a <em>Senior Software Engineer</em>.</p><p>I spent my first 4 years there on the Edge team, which was around 20 engineers building and operating a software layer that sat between client devices and backend services. “Edge” in this case was the edge of Netflix’s server infrastructure, which carried a heavy operational burden.</p><p>It felt like the first step in every production incident was for us to prove we weren’t to blame for it. This was annoying but effective; colleagues assumed that if every client request goes through our system, then we must have logs or metrics captured by our system that identify and clarify problems. We often did, and when we didn’t, we worked to close the gaps. Of course, sometimes we <em>did</em> cause incidents, and on occasion, “we” was “me”.</p><p>Over a few years, we solved the most pressing problems by increasing resiliency, building flexible edge routing, and enabling predictive autoscaling. If I reflect on these projects and others from my time at the video streaming giant, there wasn’t architecture in the sense that I’d seen before. Those who proposed ideas also did the work, which avoided the awkward white-collar vs. blue-collar split that often arises between architects and engineers in tech workplaces. Most technical ideas originated in the “trenches”, resulting in deliberate architectural choices with obvious value. Over time, we entered a new era that involved extensive conversations about creating massive new systems to solve imaginary future problems, instead of real, present ones.</p><p><strong>A new behavioral archetype formed at the company – the “Architect”. </strong>I am talking about engineers who hovered around the work, pushed new ideas, and didn’t make material contributions to day-to-day struggles. They weren’t on our on-call rotations, ostensibly because their managers wanted to give them more time to brainstorm new ideas, so they had ample time for conversations and intellectual enquiry, while the rest of us did grimy, operational work. Over lunch one day, a colleague and I discussed the situation. “I’m not sure what the solution is”, I said. “The solution”, he replied, “is to not have architects.”<em> </em>I laughed, then realized he wasn’t joking.</p><p><strong>I thought Netflix didn’t </strong><em><strong>need</strong></em><strong> architects, and considered this more broadly: does any company </strong><em><strong>really</strong></em><strong> need them? </strong>Let’s examine why the role of Architect exists. I believe it’s an artifact of the old-school waterfall fantasy:</p><ol><li><p>Design: Architects think big thoughts and draw diagrams</p></li><li><p>Build: Engineers turn diagrams into code</p></li><li><p>Test: QA finds bugs</p></li><li><p>Operate: Ops keeps the systems running smoothly</p></li></ol><p>These four phases are inescapable, and every company approaches them in its own unique way. Imagine an axis: on the left, there’s a distinct role for each phase, and on the right, there’s a single role performing them. Every company lives somewhere on this axis.</p><p>For example, the shift towards agile at big companies made “big design, up front” less popular, and often combined <em>Design</em> and <em>Build</em> into a single, continuous phase. And the shift towards cloud, DevOps, and the “you write it, you run it” model often blends <em>Build</em>, <em>Test</em>, and <em>Operate</em> into a single phase.</p><p>So, why did Netflix introduce architects? My perception is that this was related to scope: our management chain believed we needed bigger, bolder ideas to redefine how our systems worked, and that those tasked with achieving this needed distance from day-to-day work.</p><p>It sounds perfectly logical, but I’ve never seen it work. I didn’t try to fix it – I switched teams and moved to the Personalization Infrastructure group, a domain I’d always been interested in. This team was newer and they were solving concrete problems. As I understand, the Edge team continued on the path of re-visualizing their platform with great success.</p><p><strong>On a long enough timeline, success breeds specialization.</strong> You solve the hardest problems and management asks, “What’s our 3-year vision?”. Distinct groups emerge of “thinkers” and “builders”, and many companies formalize this with Principal or Staff Engineers who function as architects in all but name. From what I’ve seen, it is hard for people in these roles to avoid becoming disconnected from reality: their minds are powerful, but structure and incentives make it difficult to find appropriate targets.</p><h2>2. Trading off today’s problems for tomorrow’s: migrating to AWS</h2><p>The most significant tradeoff I saw at Netflix involved a decision that predated my time there: moving the company’s entire infrastructure to AWS. “So what?” you may think; lots of companies run everything in AWS.</p><p>Sure, lots of companies do so <em>today</em>, but none of significant scale did in 2010. I recall reading a few <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/four-reasons-we-choose-amazons-cloud-as-our-computing-platform-4aceb692afec">blog</a> <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/5-lessons-weve-learned-using-aws-1f2a28588e4c">posts</a> about Netflix’s AWS migration before I joined, and thinking, “they’re insane.” But after I joined and saw the situation up close, it made a lot of sense.</p><p>What are the repercussions of running in a datacenter, on-prem, non-cloud environment?</p><ul><li><p>Stable networking and hardware.</p></li><li><p>Fixed capacity constraints. Perhaps not <em>permanently</em> fixed, but capacity can be increased as fast as machines are purchased, racked, and put online.</p></li></ul><p>What are the consequences of running in AWS or other cloud environments?</p><ul><li><p>Virtually unlimited, elastic capacity.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Unstable networking and hardware. If “unstable” sounds harsh, let’s call it “much less stable than desired.”</p></li></ul><p>If that was everything, then the business case for elastic capacity was strong enough to declare the AWS migration a solid trade. But from the perspective of the Edge team, this trade sent us down a path of many other problems.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>Obsessing over <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/making-the-netflix-api-more-resilient-a8ec62159c2d">resiliency</a> by building <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-hystrix-for-resilience-engineering-13531c1ab362">libraries</a> to implement <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/fault-tolerance-in-a-high-volume-distributed-system-91ab4faae74a">circuit breakers, concurrency limits, and fallbacks</a>, as well as <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/hystrix-dashboard-turbine-stream-aggregator-60985a2e51df">dashboards to observe this behavior in real time</a>.</p></li><li><p>Detecting and terminating bad AWS instances.</p></li><li><p>Refining <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-shares-cloud-load-balancing-and-failover-tool-eureka-c10647ef95e5">service discovery and software load balancing</a> for hundreds of elastic clusters.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning reactive autoscaling policies.</p></li><li><p>Abandoning reactive autoscaling and building a <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/scryer-netflixs-predictive-auto-scaling-engine-a3f8fc922270">predictive</a> <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/scryer-netflixs-predictive-auto-scaling-engine-part-2-bb9c4f9b9385">autoscaling</a> system from scratch.</p></li></ul><p>These were problems we wouldn’t have had if we’d stayed in the data center. But they were also exponentially better than having fixed-capacity software and constrained customer growth. This was not only a good tradeoff for the business – it also catalyzed a planet-scale improvement of our engineering capabilities.</p><h2>3.

I had no idea what he was talking about, but he was highly respected by senior teammates, so I paid close attention.</p><p>A few weeks later, I had some free time and we paired up to prototype some of his ideas. His code was atrocious and he had a hard time getting anything to work. But he said something which struck my young mind as profound:</p><blockquote><p>“We’ve got SQL queries hardcoded into the UI”, he said. “We should change that so that the UI calls a service which abstracts the query behind a concept, like ‘get all items for the current user’”.</p></blockquote><p><em>That’s a great idea</em>, I thought. Over the next few years, I learned a ton from him about testing, separation of concerns, hot and cold storage, compression, data formats and schemas, and more. But I never reconciled how a person so bad at writing code could have such solid ideas about system design. A larger point emerged:</p><p><strong>Someone’s ability to write high-quality code is entirely independent of their ability to create or recognize high-quality architecture.</strong></p><p>I’ve worked for engineering leaders who hadn’t written code in years, yet had a brilliant sense of technical fundamentals. When necessary, they grabbed the wheel and steered their teams away from expensive mistakes and towards bountiful opportunities. They didn’t have great coding skills, but possessed impeccable design sense, instincts, and taste.</p><p>I’ve also worked with engineers who were experts in various programming minutiae, yet had no clear ability to build systems that could work together coherently and functionally. Their ability to optimally implement classes or functions did not extend beyond the source files they edited.</p><p>Architecture connects systems built with code, but is a distinct discipline from coding with limited overlap. You cannot LeetCode your way into a cohesive, opportunistic architecture that serves the business.</p><p>Why not? Let’s explore the “good at architecture, bad at code” archetype. I’ve found these individuals are drawn to the most essential details. When designing a new system, they ask questions like:</p><ul><li><p>What data can we collect to ensure things work correctly?</p></li><li><p>What is the maximum acceptable latency for clients of this system?</p></li><li><p>Do we need to compute results in real time, or can we do it offline in batch mode?</p></li></ul><p>They are generally less concerned with details like class hierarchies, method names, and directory structures, which are trivial in the broader business and distributed systems contexts.</p><p>But code can’t be completely irrelevant, right? Let’s examine the “good at code, bad at architecture” archetype, which I think occurs when individuals haven’t had a role in which things like network latency, fallbacks, or failure modes are first-class citizens.</p><p>Note, I use the word “architecture” to mean “distributed systems architecture”, which is common and also biased towards my personal experience.</p><p>At Netflix, we’d often find that backend services had slow memory leaks, which took a long time to discover and fix because instances rarely lived longer than 48 hours, due to autoscaling policies. If we had chosen to focus on memory leaks instead of autoscaling, Netflix would have been unable to scale to meet demand, and would’ve been a much smaller business.</p><h3>Good architecture unifies people, not only systems</h3><p>A few years later, as a Staff Engineer at a large social media company, I led a project to build analytics for our real-time content personalization system.</p><p>The existing design had evolved from a prototype built before I joined. We generated events from our runtime systems that briefly sat in a queue before being exported into an external datastore.</p><p>These events captured information such as:</p><ul><li><p>Which content was served to whom at what time</p></li><li><p>ML model scores for each user/item pair</p></li></ul><p>This data enabled us to:</p><ul><li><p>Track bias across different phases of personalization, from candidate generation to filtering, ranking, and serving</p></li><li><p>Investigate and debug issues, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Why do some users receive empty pages with zero recommendations?</p></li><li><p>Why is some content unexpectedly served much more than others?</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>From a “social” point of view, there was much to consider:</p><ul><li><p>My queue of stakeholders grew exponentially, as everyone suggested two other people to consult.</p></li><li><p>“We need a design” was a recurring theme among those I talked to. When I asked what goals the current design was preventing us from achieving, I didn’t receive useful answers.</p></li><li><p>There was a prototype for a competing project that a few engineers on the team felt we should use instead of the current system.</p></li><li><p>The line between what was and wasn’t “analytics” was blurry. For example, we were asked multiple times if we could log ML features along with analytics data. We always declined due to a tight schedule, but I felt that we were missing an opportunity to solve a broader, more impactful problem.</p></li></ul><p>We needed a cohesive vision to get everyone on the same wavelength, so I wrote a design document to achieve this which described the problem we were solving – both business-wise and scale-wise – and added a bunch of diagrams. I presented a few options for refining the project and described what I felt was the best path, and why. Then I shared the document.</p><p>After a few weeks of conversations with the team and stakeholders, nothing improved and the situation had become notably worse. The team was more fractured than ever, with multiple sub-teams moving in different directions. The notion of a comprehensive analytics solution felt like a distant dream.</p><p>I left the company shortly after this, as I no longer felt it was the right fit. But I asked myself for months afterwards what I could have done differently to deliver a better result. I always come back to one answer:</p><p><strong>I was too focused on solving a technical problem when the primary issue was a social one.</strong></p><p>My job had not been to just make optimal technical decisions. It was to bring everyone together with a unifying vision, whether it was technically optimal or not.</p><p>In the video ranking case mentioned above, I lobbied for that project intermittently for over a year before work started: I presented slides and sent them to anyone I could find, gathered a bunch of data, and made more slides. Things went quiet for a while. And then, finally, the stars aligned and we started moving.</p><p>In the corporate world, objectively good ideas are rare. Ideas don’t have to be <em>good</em> per se; they just have to move people forward. Of course, good ideas are more likely to move people than bad ones, but in workplaces, something is “good” when the right people agree it is.</p><h3>Good architecture balances the practical with the aspirational</h3><p>Around the year 2020, I was working at a large US TV operator as a Principal Engineer. My role was focused on making broad improvements to personalized video ranking, and I partnered with an Architect to address the problem of making video ranking more flexible. Historically, most content was served by the product either via search, or a variety of human-curated collections. Fully personalizing our content required connecting multiple functions, systems, and teams in a new way.</p><p>Let’s talk about those teams briefly. Our primary partner was the Search team, a group of 20 or so engineers who operated a high-volume search index, along with a system to access all editorially curated content collections. Their priority was serving relevant search results in a stable, highly available way. A change to their system usually took at least a month to land in production.</p><p>We were the Personalization team, a mixture of around 10 Machine Learning Researchers and Software Engineers. We owned several services that provided personalized content to users at runtime, along with numerous data pipelines and random batch jobs. Our priority was increasing user engagement by maximizing the amount of personalized content served. If you asked us to make a change to our system, we could likely get it in production in two business days.</p><p>Our goal was to create a proposal with a high chance of winning buy-in from partner teams. One of my self-imposed constraints was that the proposal to increase personalization had to be achievable within our current responsibilities and organizational structure. We needed to increase the speed at which we could put new features and experiments into production, so we had to be mindful and realistic about the demands placed upon the slowest-moving teams.</p><p>My architect partner disagreed, saying:</p><blockquote><p>“We should propose the best technical solution. And if that requires organizational changes, let the managers figure it out.”</p></blockquote><p>It was an interesting idea, but at the time, a proposal requiring a reorg went nowhere fast at that company. It would also limit my opportunities to write future proposals.</p><p>In this case, the Search team moved slowly for legitimate reasons. The Personalization team moved quickly, also for legitimate reasons. One of the goals of our proposed architectural changes was to increase the speed of testing new ML models in production. If adding a new model or configuring an existing model involved manual changes and testing by the Search team, then we would continue to move slowly at their pace. To ignore this constraint would be to provide a proposal of limited value.</p><p><strong>A common stereotype of Architects is that they propose things that don’t work in the real world</strong>. Their solutions require a new, perfect world to be constructed beforehand. In our case, a perfect world could be created by a reorg that breaks apart the Search team, or maybe by rewriting all services from scratch.</p><p>But conceiving new worlds isn’t the problem; the problem is the inability to intersect a perfect world with the one that actually exists. Sure, maybe a reorg or rewrite would be ideal, but in the meantime, can we deliver something valuable within current constraints to reveal opportunities being missed in the current state?</p><p>We were strategically exposed, and mitigated this issue via prototyping. We couldn’t win buy-in for a broad proposal, so proposed three different architectures and ran them in parallel with a small amount of real customer traffic. The option with the highest demand on the Search team performed significantly worse than the others, partially due to some architectural flaws, but mostly because they moved more slowly than the Personalization team. Production traffic is the ultimate practical differentiator.</p><h2>4. Bad architecture is a lot of work that doesn’t change much</h2><p>Let’s discuss the Principal Engineer role from the <em>“Good architecture balances the practical with the aspirational”</em> section above. I was asked to review a proposal for an “improving personalization architecture” initiative led by an engineer on a team I worked with. It was filled with clearly-stated decisions, such as:</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Monday was an interesting day: Signal stopped working, Slack and Zoom had issues, and most Amazon services were also down. The cause was a 14-hour-long AWS outage in the us-east-1 region. In this issue of The Pulse, we look deeper into what happened and the causes, covering:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Worldwide impact. </strong>From Ring cameras, Robinhood, Snapchat, and Duolingo, all the way to Substack – sites and services went down in their thousands.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unexpected AWS dependencies. </strong>Status pages using Atlassian’s Statuspage product could not be updated, Eight Sleep mattresses were effectively bricked for users, Postman was unusable, UK taxpayers couldn’t access the HMRC portal, and a Premier League game was interrupted.</p></li><li><p><strong>What caused the outage? </strong>A DNS race condition at DynamoDB, Amazon EC2 getting into a congestive collapse, and network propagation issues all stretched the outage to 14 hours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why such dependency on us-east-1?</strong> It feels like half of the internet is on us-east-1 for its low pricing and high capacity. Meanwhile, some AWS services are themselves dependent on this region.</p></li></ol><p>There’s a joke that when aws us-east-1 sneezes, the world catches a cold. It’s the most popular region to deploy services in; for many companies it’s the default region of choice. It’s also the case that aws-us-east-1 is the largest and oldest of AWS’s regions and the company itself has several dependencies located there. A us-east-1 region-wide outage usually results in AWS-wide issues which can affect many websites, apps, and infrastructure companies.</p><h2>1.

        <h2 class="post-title">San Francisco is back as the world’s leading tech hub</h2>
        <span class="post-date">October 28, 2025</span>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Starting in 2020, the pandemic emptied offices and changed the ways tech companies operate, and how us techies work and collaborate, by making remote and hybrid work patterns the norm. San Francisco (SF) on the US West Coast became emblematic of a major shift: we saw <a href="https://sfciti.org/news/press-release/new-data-on-the-san-francisco-tech-exodus/">an exodus</a> of tech companies from the city as Pinterest, Stripe, PayPal, and others <a href="https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2022/12/12/pinterest-to-bail-out-of-sf-offices-in-soma/">downsized</a>, Tesla and Oracle <a href="https://buildremote.co/companies/businesses-leaving-san-francisco/">moved</a> to Texas, and many VCs, founders, and startups <a href="https://x.com/rabois/status/1387807609470820357">quit</a> for other locations, or simply went fully remote.</p><p>But today, things are changing again. I’ve just returned from San Francisco, where I visited the headquarters of several leading AI companies and up-and-coming startups. Based on my conversations and observations, SF is most definitely back – and it’s more important than ever.</p><p>A new wave of AI startups has been the catalyst to make SF into a buzzing tech hub once more: there are ever more startups launching in the city, the AI meetup scene is energetic, and it’s easy for people to collaborate with one another in person. The tech hub model is proving its value all over again in SF, and might even be one reason for the incredible growth and adoption of AI products and services. <em>Of course, Silicon Valley has no shortage of innovation, VC funding – and a substantial Big Tech presence – but SF stands out for the number of high-growth startups headquartered there.</em></p><p>The city looks like a trailblazer for the re-emergence of the tech hub model, reverting back from the remote work surge of 2020-2023. For companies and professionals, this seems relevant – wherever they’re based.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cursor: push for release 2.0</strong>. A cozy office and a focus on shipping.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI dev tools startups ahead of the curve.</strong> Wispr Flow wants devs to code more by talking, Continue is the “CI/CD infra for AI agents”, and Factory builds AI agents for engineering teams.</p></li><li><p><strong>OpenAI.</strong> Scaling faster than any company ever. 10x infra growth for two years straight, with no signs of that slowing down. Refreshingly, OpenAI also hires junior engineers as well as seniors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anthropic.</strong> Self-organization at scale. Cofounder and former CTO Sam McCandlish shared what helps the company grow, and we discussed their tech stack and engineering challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buzzing meetups. </strong>The local chapter of <a href="https://aitinkerers.org/">AI Tinkerers</a> was brimming with “builder energy”, and more than the usual amount of insider knowledge about models, maybe because OpenAI and Anthropic are headquartered next door.</p></li><li><p><strong>Location, location, location. </strong>San Francisco-based AI startups seem like they’re getting more traction, faster. Location may play a role as it’s easy to network, sell to other startups, and hire engineers working on cutting-edge technologies.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI wave, bubble, or both?</strong> It’s hard to be certain, but it feels like there hasn’t been this rate of explosive growth since the pre-millennium Dotcom Boom.</p></li></ol><p><em>As always, I have no affiliation with the companies mentioned in this article, and am not paid to write about them. More in <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement.</a></em></p><h2>1. Cursor: push for release 2.0</h2><p>People swap their shoes for slippers when they arrive at Cursor’s headquarters at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Beach,_San_Francisco">North Beach</a>, SF, and there was a chill atmosphere during my visit there. That might suggest cosiness, but everyone was focused on the work, with a lot of in-person pairing taking place during what was the final stage of readying Cursor 2.0 for launch. It’s going to be their biggest release since <a href="https://cursor.com/changelog/1-0">the 1.0 launch</a> in June.</p><p><strong>An interesting workflow: automatic ticket resolution</strong>. Every incoming Linear ticket is automatically assigned to a Cursor agent, which one-shots a suggested fix, and a developer can then decide whether to merge it.

Founded in 2024, the startup found its product-market fit this January, cofounder and CEO <a href="https://x.com/tankots">Tanay Kothari</a> told me, when the product experienced 90% month-on-month growth which was purely organic without any advertising spend. At the time, the startup saw an impressive 20% free-to-paid conversion rate. Ten months later, this conversion remains unchanged: for every 5 new monthly active users, 1 becomes paid.</p><p>In the office, every desk is fitted with a $70 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF969RVP">BOYA Gooseneck microphone</a>, into which devs whisper. Despite the coding being done by voice, it was quiet in the office and I couldn’t hear Wispr’s ML Lead, Menoua Keshishian, while he worked in close vicinity with his microphone.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":906,"width":1258,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":null,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":null,"href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":null,"isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="906" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hLlY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f03670e-aaaf-456d-ae0d-8fae63ca539f_1258x906.png 1456w" width="1258"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Wispr Flow’s headquarters: ML Lead Menoua Keshishian (left) whispering to Cursor. Bottom right, me with the world’s biggest 3D-printed keyboard</figcaption></figure></div><p>Wispr’s popularity with devs is due to a few reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dictation, not transcription. </strong>There are countless voice-to-text products that transcribe the spoken word, but this is not useful for coding! For example, if you say: “let’s start a server on localhost 3000… no, sorry, localhost 8000”, you want the transcript to be able to recognise and cut out the noise, and to read: “let’s start a server on localhost:8000”.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dev-friendly touches. </strong>When a dev says “localhost 3000”, the software automatically generates “localhost:3000.” There are many small touches which help with coding use cases.</p></li><li><p><strong>IDE integrations. </strong>Wispr integrates nicely with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and Visual Studio Code.

They refer to themselves as “continuous AI” that runs background agents.</p><p>In pre-AI times, you would have the Continuous Integration (CI) server kick off, run linting, run tests, and report back the results. But with AI agents, there are so many more possibilities! For example:</p><ul><li><p>Summarize the impact of a change</p></li><li><p>Generate an architecture diagram of the change if it’s big enough to warrant one</p></li><li><p>Verify that API endpoints work correctly if the change touches API endpoints</p></li><li><p>Generate documentation for the change</p></li><li><p>Run an evals suite on a change (LLMs evaluate the correctness of changes)</p></li><li><p>Create a performance analysis of the change</p></li><li><p>… and more</p></li></ul><p>Yes, it was already possible to hook up an LLM with a CI/CD and do all these changes, but larger companies have more to consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Control which models and LLMs are used.</strong> You might want to self-host LLMs, optimize for cost or performance, or run parallel LLMs and compare results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Worry more about security. </strong>You want to be very selective about giving LLMs access to credentials like API keys which they might need for testing. Should access even be given?</p></li><li><p><strong>Logging and auditing.</strong> LLMs are nondeterministic, so things sometimes go wrong. You want to have logs and be able to track exactly which agent did what, and when.</p></li></ul><p>I chatted with Continue’s Head of DX, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianldouglas/">Brian Douglas</a>, and he <a href="https://github.com/bdougie/contributor.info/pull/1087">kicked off the background agent</a> for a fix committed to their repository. The agent did the following things:</p><ul><li><p>Summarized the problem and solution</p></li><li><p>Created an architecture diagram</p></li><li><p>Verified whether documentation changes were needed</p></li><li><p>Came up with a merge recommendation and additional suggestions</p></li><li><p>Analyzed code quality</p></li></ul><p>You can review all the actions <a href="https://github.com/bdougie/contributor.info/pull/1087">on this pull request</a>, which was a “one-shot process” where the agent went off and did a bunch of work based on a single piece of input from an engineer.</p><p>Among AI startups, the “996” model for the workday is <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/new-trend-extreme-hours-at-ai-startups/">spreading fast</a>, especially in San Francisco. The name refers to 9am to 9pm work hours, 6 days a week. But Continue is showing that a punishing work pattern is not the only way to succeed. During my visit, the office was largely empty at 5:30pm. Everyone works hard while they’re there, Brian said:</p><blockquote><p>“If we work silly long hours, it’s mainly because we are already excited about the solution we are shipping, not because there’s some unwritten expectation to stay late at the office. At Continue, the emphasis is on results, not desk time. Some of the team take advantage of hybrid days to do focused work”.</p></blockquote><p>Continue already counts major AI labs and Big Tech companies among its customers: the ones that set up these LLM-powered CI/CD workflows. Continue.dev is a good example of how much a small team can achieve by working hard and smart. <em>Learn more about them by checking out these <a href="https://docs.continue.dev/guides/overview#mcp-integration-cookbooks">MCP “cookbooks”</a> showing how the platform works.

One possible reason OpenAI executes faster than most startups is its in-person work culture that has existed since its early days, as we covered in a 2023 deepdive into <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">OpenAI’s engineering culture</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":750,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":null,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":null,"href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":null,"isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="750" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!a-DN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67e9a80f-cc52-4231-bc76-38092130e412_1600x824.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">OpenAI’s offices, and swag</figcaption></figure></div><p>During my visit, I met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sulmanc/">Sulman Choudhry</a>, who heads up ChatGPT’s Engineering and Applied Research functions. He had a few interesting things to say:</p><p><strong>OpenAI now hires junior engineers, not just seniors. </strong>The company is finding success with a “super senior + super junior” mix. Super juniors are early-career software engineers, who are AI-native, entrepreneurial, and several of whom were at the startup accelerator Y Combinator, which is also headquartered in San Francisco. Super juniors use AI tools in ways that surprise more experienced colleagues, Sulman said.</p><p>For example, one super junior did an impressive piece of work, and Sulman asked if he’d used Codex for it. This prompted a defensive response, which Sulman thought might signify that the junior had hand-coded most of it and resented the suggestion that they’d simply delegated the task to AI. Sulman recounted the engineer’s reply:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s a little insulting that you ask if I used Codex for it. Of course, Codex by itself couldn’t build software of this complexity, and you probably also know it.</p><p>It’s why I had to use <em>many</em> instances of Codexes to build it, setting up communication channels between instances, so they can take on the task, one of them validating it, and others implementing the specialized parts.”</p></blockquote><p>So, the engineer was <em>not</em> annoyed by the assumption they’d used Codex; they were irked that it was assumed they’d employed only a <em>single</em> instance of it! <em>Come on, who would want to slow themselves down so much by doing that?! </em>Super juniors at OpenAI are pushing the limits of AI tools, and inspiring more experienced engineers to use them in new ways.</p><h4>Weekly internal ChatGPT demos</h4><p>Unsurprisingly, every engineer and team builds custom tools, and there’s an explosion of MCP servers connected to Codex. Each week, teams demo the tools they build and share things that work for them, and how they are changing their workflows.</p><p><strong>A recent interesting demo was a “fix this” button integrated into the internal version of the OpenAI mobile app</strong>. We’re all familiar with the “report a bug” button in mobile apps: it takes a screenshot, you describe what’s wrong, and then submit it. A team at OpenAI took this a step further: you fill out the bug report, and then tap a “fix it” button. The bug report goes to Codex and a fix is drafted. An engineer needs to approve the fix – but the feedback loop is much faster!</p><p>That demo was so successful that the “fix it” button is now part of ChatGPT.</p><h4>Scaling faster than everyone</h4><p>To learn about infrastructure challenges, I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmaytang/">Emma Tang</a>, who heads up OpenAI’s Data Platform team which owns four main areas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Big data infrastructure</strong>: operating things like a Data Lake (a centralized repository storing massive amounts of raw data), <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> (distributed computing framework to process large-scale data), <a href="https://trino.io/">Trino</a> (formerly known as PrestoSQL, a distributed SQL query engine), <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a> (workflow orchestration), business intelligence tools and dashboards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time streaming: </strong>supporting infrastructure platforms operating at scale like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> (distributed event streaming and message broker), <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Flink</a> (stream processing), and an internal system called K-Forwarder.</p></li><li><p><strong>ML infrastructure: </strong>non-LLM product features, recommendation services, and a <a href="https://chronon.ai/">Chronon</a> feature store (an open source feature platform for ML engineering created by Airbnb.)</p></li><li><p><strong>“Flywheel team”: </strong>a team unique to OpenAI that’s responsible for production data scrubbing, removing all personal identifiable information (PII), and preparing training data.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Compute demand for the infra layer has grown 10x annually for the past two years. </strong>The compute for the fleet serving the infrastructure and data lake storage has vastly expanded, and there’s no sign of that slowing down. Emma discussed how growing so fast creates engineering challenges:</p><ul><li><p>Building for scalability without needing to rewrite the system, even as it grew to ~100x scale in 2 years. Scaling is done horizontally: the team went from having 1x Kafka cluster to having 5 today, and from 1x Airflow instances to 4.</p></li><li><p>Hitting technological limits: for example, encountering row size limits in Spark data frames from storing lengthy chat conversations.</p></li><li><p>Adding support for multimodal features across ChatGPT products involves storing much more and richer data, such as voice data, images, and PDFs.</p></li></ul><p>The data infrastructure team is very senior: around 95% of members are data infrastructure specialists, and a third are members of the Apache Project Management Committee (<a href="https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html">PMC</a>). Spark, Airflow, Kafka, and Flink are all Apache projects, and a third of the team are committers to at least one of them.</p><p><strong>Fundamental rewrites might be unavoidable. </strong>Even though the team prepares for as much growth as possible, the next 10x tranche of growth might require major rewrites, since it’s hard to keep patching a system that’s achieving such magnitudes of growth (around 1,000x) without rethinking some basics. Needless to say, a rewrite would involve increasingly challenging migrations.</p><p><strong>Personal reflections on OpenAI: </strong>The engineers I met are motivated, focused, and at the top of their game. The scale of engineering challenges they face are rare, and engineers get unusually high autonomy to solve difficult problems. There is no lack of ambition, nor signs of stalling growth.</p><p>We cover more about OpenAI in these deepdives:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images">Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship">Inside OpenAI: how does ChatGPT ship so quickly?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt?utm_source=publication-search">Scaling ChatGPT: five real-world engineering challenges</a></p></li></ul><h2>4. Anthropic: self-organization at scale</h2><p>At Anthropic, I sat down with cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-mccandlish/">Sam McCandlish</a>, who was until very recently the CTO. Sam is a quantum gravity physicist by education who worked at OpenAI, and then joined Anthropic’s founding team. Since then, he’s helped the company grow from a workforce of 7 to more than 2,000 today. Over the last 4 years, Sam has committed code to pretty much every system across the company, and has worked in research and engineering. After onboarding Anthropic’s new CTO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-patil-a0944836/">Rahul Patil</a> (formerly CTO at Stripe), he plans to return to solving problems in large-scale model training. I found him thoughtful, open, and humble; someone who thinks from first principles.</p><h4>Anthropic’s rapid growth challenges</h4><p>I asked Sam how he approached the company’s breakneck speed of growth. He made a few points:</p>

If it’s for a personal tool, something throw away, in the old days, if an engineer or a PM had an idea, maybe we would put together a quick mock, maybe we would put together a wireframe or a sketch or something like that. Perhaps work with UX to come up with something a little bit more polished.</p><p><strong>I think that tests are great.</strong> And if you are open to tests, it can be a great way of de-risking your use of LLMs and coding. Because sometimes, even if you’re using state-of-the-art models, you can end up in a situation where maybe the code looks more convoluted than you would expect. Or maybe your first couple of prompts have been generating really good code, and then for whatever reason, things go off. the rails. But if you can prove that things are working with tests and that if something did go off the rails, it’s clearer to you what that was, I think that that can help you keep your project green the whole time.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/vibe-coding-as-a-software-engineer">Vibe Coding as a software engineer</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering">How AI-assisted coding will change software engineering: hard truths</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world">AI Engineering in the real world</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack">The AI Engineering stack</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-claude-code-is-built">How Claude Code is built</a></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Timestamps</strong></h3><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=137s">02:17</a>) Vibe coding vs. AI-assisted engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=367s">06:07</a>) How Addy uses AI tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=790s">13:10</a>) Addy’s learnings about applying AI for development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=1127s">18:47</a>) Addy’s favorite tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=1335s">22:15</a>) The 70% Problem</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=1695s">28:15</a>) Tactics for efficient LLM usage</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=1978s">32:58</a>) How AI tools evolved</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=2069s">34:29</a>) The case for keeping expectations low and control high</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=2285s">38:05</a>) Autonomous agents and working with them</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=2569s">42:49</a>) How the EM and PM role changes with AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=2834s">47:14</a>) The rise of new roles and shifts in developer education</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=2891s">48:11</a>) The importance of critical thinking when working with AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=3248s">54:08</a>) LLMs as a tool for learning</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHIppEqwi0g&amp;t=3830s">1:03:50</a>) Rapid questions</p><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><p><strong>Where to find Addy Osmani:</strong></p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/addyosmani">https://x.com/addyosmani</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/addyosmani">https://www.linkedin.com/in/addyosmani</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://addyosmani.com">https://addyosmani.com</a></p><p>• Newsletter: </p><div class="embedded-publication-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:2115638,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Elevate&quot;,&quot;logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8WxC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3704470-b6d5-48a9-a9d1-564bd833fc5c_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;base_url&quot;:&quot;https://addyo.substack.com&quot;,&quot;hero_text&quot;:&quot;Addy Osmani's newsletter on elevating your effectiveness.

        <span class="post-date">November 04, 2025</span>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>“What is the state of the tech jobs market in 2025?” is the question this article tackles in the third and final part of our mini-series on that major subject. We hear from job platforms, and from tech professionals searching for their next opportunity. This article features Wellfound (a jobs platform with around 6M software engineering profiles), and data from Revealera, an alternative data platform. There are also more than 30 software engineers and engineering leaders who discussed their job hunting experience with me. Today, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Job platform data. </strong>Falling demand for remote work, more “barriers” put up by companies, slightly higher demand for backend engineers than before, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Junior engineer recruitment rebounds? </strong>More scaleups and publicly traded tech companies are doubling down on hiring new grads and early-career engineers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Picky employers. </strong>More hiring managers hold out for the “perfect candidate,” more rejections come with no feedback, and some think the candidate quality is down, overall. Referrals seem like the only way to consistently get interviews.</p></li><li><p><strong>Software engineer archetypes in and out of demand. </strong>AI engineers, those with Big Tech experience, and infra+SRE engineers are in demand. Times are reportedly tougher for candidates who took career breaks, are self-taught, or are native mobile engineers.</p></li><li><p><strong>State of engineering leadership hiring. </strong>It’s very tough everywhere, especially for experienced engineering managers not yet at Director level. One executive recruiter says many leadership candidates have poor AI skills and unrealistic pay expectations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote market</strong>. It’s harder to land a job and compensation is lower, but the bar is higher for remote positions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regional observations. </strong>Outside of cities, the market is tougher: in Germany, Wayfair’s exit could drag down pay. Are Swiss companies looking to hire in cheaper EU countries?</p></li></ol><p>Previous articles in this series covered:</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025">Part 1: what the data says</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Tech job stats</p></li><li><p>AI Engineering trends</p></li><li><p>Big Tech hiring stats</p></li><li><p>Growing importance of location</p></li><li><p>Tenure rising fast at Big Tech</p></li><li><p>Where are Big Tech engineers moving to and from?</p></li><li><p>Engineering leadership recruitment</p></li><li><p>Remote jobs</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025-hiring-managers">Part 2: what hiring managers see</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Flood of applications</p></li><li><p>Few hires via inbound</p></li><li><p>‘Top’ candidates are hard to find</p></li><li><p>Remote jobs: more competition for less comp?</p></li><li><p>Fake applicants + AI: a growing problem</p></li><li><p>Higher demand for founding engineers and product engineers</p></li><li><p>Early-stage startups have their own hiring problems</p></li></ul><p><em>As usual, I have no affiliation with vendors mentioned in this article, and have not been paid to write about them. More in <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement</a>.</em></p><h2>1. Job platform data</h2><p>In Part 2 of this mini-series, we <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/175538073/linkedin-home-of-low-quality-inbound-applications">covered</a> how some hiring managers are shifting to recruit on sites like <strong><a href="https://wellfound.com/">Wellfound</a></strong> (formerly: Angellist Talent) because LinkedIn has gotten too noisy for finding candidates efficiently.</p><p>Wellfound has <strong>12M active candidates</strong> on its site, of which circa 50% are software engineers. More than <strong>27,000 companies</strong> use the site for recruitment, with more than 100,000 hires made, to date. As a jobs marketplace, Wellfound does not filter. Its CEO <a href="https://wellfound.com/p/amit">Amit Matani</a> has shared the trends they see, right now:</p><p><strong>According to Wellfound’s data, the job market was most competitive in January 2025,</strong> when applications per job peaked on the site. Today, the number is down 10% from that height – meaning it’s now slightly easier to stand out as a candidate. Even so, the job market is very tough compared to 2021:</p><ul><li><p>6x as many applicants per remote job</p></li><li><p>5x as many applicants per in-person job</p></li></ul><p><strong>There’s a big rise in AI engineering job ads. </strong>Overall, this is the most visible trend on the platform, and it matches trends covered <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/172584839/ai-engineering-trends">in Part 1 of this mini-series.</a> <em>For advice on getting into AI Engineering, check out the deepdives, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world">AI Engineering in the real world</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack">The AI Engineering stack</a>.</em></p><h3>What makes an in-demand candidate?</h3><p>I asked Amit about profiles of candidates which are most popular with employers, meaning types of folks whom companies reach out to the most. He revealed:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI product engineers</strong>. Those who can build AI products end-to-end (fullstack + LLMs + evals + RAG).</p></li><li><p><strong>Data engineers and backend engineers. </strong>Visibly rising demand for these.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI-native engineers: </strong>Engineers who are experts in how to use AI tools to significantly boost productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pedigree means up to 50x more reachouts. </strong>Profiles with high-profile schools and workplaces get up to 20-50x more reachouts than similar profiles with not as much “pedigree”. This is not unique to software engineering, says Amit, nor to 2025.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-person much more in demand. </strong>Most hiring is by companies headquartered in US metropolitan centers, and engineers in such areas get many more reachouts than candidates who work full-remote.</p></li><li><p><strong>The San Francisco Bay Area has the most job postings</strong> – not even a contest.

Source: Wellfound</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Hiring trends: candidates face more barriers</h3><p>Below are some trends among employers from Wellfound’s data:</p><p>Hiring pipeline trends:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Inbound: noisier. </strong>This still drives some hires for all companies, but has become the noisiest channel of all. Employers face more work combing through large numbers of inbound applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Most companies focus on sourcing. </strong>They reach out to potential candidates directly, instead of waiting on inbound applications.</p></li></ul><p>Screening trends:</p><ul><li><p><strong>More barriers for job seekers. </strong>Inbound is noisy because there’s lots of applications, but most are under-qualified. So, companies place barriers like asking additional questions upfront, scheduling async calls, assigning coding assessments – and even doing AI interviews in advance.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI tools for ranking and filtering candidates.</strong> To deal with high volumes of inbound applications, AI tools are used to filter out applicants who are likely to be fakers, and to create an order of priority for identifying strong inbound applications. There’s still human review, and no such thing as “AI rejection”, Amit told me.</p></li></ul><p>Interview trends:</p><ul><li><p><strong>More in-person interviews </strong>and lengthier takehome exercises.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trial days or weeks, pre-offer. </strong>More companies use a trial period before making an offer. This could be a day or week where candidates work with the team. It’s pretty similar to the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/86186964/the-trial-week">paid “trial week” concept at Linear.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>AI is being integrated into interviews. </strong>Companies have accepted there will be AI in interviews, and are changing their processes to accommodate it.</p></li></ul><h3>Fake jobs, fake candidates</h3><p>I asked Amit about two topics getting plenty of attention in online forums: the suspicion that some job ads are fake (meaning no hire is made and the sole purpose is to collect resumes), and that some candidates are “fake” because they use made-up CVs and hope to get hired to jobs they’re totally unqualified for.</p><p><strong>Fake jobs: not a visible trend – but “ghosting” is. </strong>Amit shares:</p><blockquote><p>“Posting fake jobs with the sole intent of capturing resumes is not widespread – at least not on our platform, or at companies I talk to. That said, companies not responding to candidates is a problem. Candidates often don’t hear back because:</p><ul><li><p>Hiring managers / recruiters are indecisive or unprepared. They might have put up a role without really being ready to hire. Or they might not be sure about a candidate, but also don’t want to “close the door” by sending a rejection.</p></li><li><p>Hiring managers are overwhelmed. Some companies we work with get 1,000 applicants a week for a single role! It’s just hard to process that.</p></li><li><p>There really isn’t much of an incentive for recruiters to send a rejection email.</p></li></ul><p>We try to incentivize following up: we give companies 2 weeks to accept or reject applications. We find that if the company does not respond within 2 weeks, the likelihood of them sending a followup is extremely low.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fake candidates are an ongoing problem. </strong>Amit:</p><blockquote><p>“Fake applicants are a problem and there are three types:</p><ul><li><p>Scammers or state actors who are impersonating candidates in order to deceive employers.</p></li><li><p>“Auto-appliers” who aren’t interested in a role and are a poor fit, but apply anyway.</p></li><li><p>Embellished profiles: candidates who add misleading information to their profiles; for example, stating they’re US-based when actually in India.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The biggest issue we’re seeing is scam candidates.</strong> It’s an issue for sourcing and applications. These candidates create Linkedin and Wellfound profiles, and apply to jobs. They also stuff their profiles with great companies and in-demand keywords so they show up when companies do sourcing. We make a lot of effort to keep such candidates off our platform with automated detection, reporting, and ID checks.</p><p>Auto-appliers are the next biggest thing: candidates who apply and are not good fits, overwhelm companies. A lot of them then ghost employers, even when one responds”.</p></blockquote><h3>More hiring trends from Wellfound</h3><p>Additional observations:</p><ul><li><p>Onsite hiring is dominant, but companies hiring remotely have the upper hand. Practically every startup Wellfound works with wants candidates to work onsite. But many candidates want the opportunity to work remotely, at least partially. Companies that hire remotely definitely have the upper hand in terms of talent choice.</p></li><li><p>There are AI budgets for recruitment. Many teams have “AI budgets” to try out new things with. So, there is a decent amount of experimentation in AI recruitment tools.</p></li><li><p>It’s an employer’s market. Companies know this and act accordingly: they are more picky, and put up more barriers.</p></li><li><p>Auto-appliers are growing. More candidates use auto-apply software to apply for hundreds or thousands of jobs. It’s a vicious cycle: with more inbound applications, fewer applicants hear back, and so more of them use auto-appliers.</p></li><li><p>Highest demand for software engineers with 3-15 years of experience, willing to work onsite. Amit shares that the most “promising” profile they see is for a software engineer with a few years of experience, based in locations where many companies hire. <em>Location has suddenly <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/172584839/growing-importance-of-location">become a lot more important</a>, as reported in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/172584839/growing-importance-of-location">Part 1</a> of this mini-series.</em></p></li></ul><h3>Shifting demand for software engineering specializations</h3><p>Revealera is a data provider of job postings for financial companies.

Junior engineer hiring to rebound?</h2><p>One unfortunate trend since 2020 is that hiring for entry-level software engineering roles seems to have almost stopped, industry-wide:</p><ul><li><p>In 2020-2022, most companies started to work remotely out of necessity due to pandemic lockdowns. Onboarding junior engineers was tough in this situation, so companies delayed hiring them.</p></li><li><p>In 2023-2024, most businesses used a hybrid setup. However, the layoff wave of 2022 increased the supply of highly skilled senior+ software engineers who used to be hard to hire. As a result, many companies hired them.</p></li></ul><p>One outcome has been a very tough period for new grads and those with little professional software engineering experience. Now, there are signs that junior-level hiring may finally be returning:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI and Anthropic</strong> are hiring junior software engineers for the first time ever. I confirmed this with engineering leaders at each place while visiting their respective headquarters in San Francisco, a few weeks ago.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shopify, GitHub, Cloudflare</strong>: uptick in internships. Shopify <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-is-changing-software-engineering">is hiring</a> 1,000 interns per year, Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/press/press-releases/2025/cloudflare-aims-to-hire-1111-interns-in-2026-to-help-train-the-next-gen/">will be onboarding</a> 1,111 interns in 2026 (the number is a nod to its 1.1.1.1 DNS address), and GitHub <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/github">is hiring</a> more interns than before. Only a subset of all interns convert into full-time employees, and Shopify has extended full-time offers to around 1 in 5 interns, so far. These companies have never invested as much in interns as now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Netflix</strong>: the streaming giant only hired senior software engineers for 25 years, but has started to onboard new grads recently, as I learned by talking with Netflix CTO, Elizabeth Stone.</p></li></ul><p>Below are anecdotes from hiring managers which suggest junior hiring could be picking up, based on my conversations with them:</p><h3>Publicly traded tech companies and scaleups</h3><blockquote><p>“<strong>After two years, we’re hiring juniors again. </strong>Our company pushed AI to its limit, where people were allowed to push 10K lines of code PRs that were barely reviewed. This has caused an unmaintainable mess at the foundational layer. So my company did not hire junior engineers for the past two years. Now they are walking back from it.” – Engineering Manager, publicly traded company, San Francisco.</p><p>“<strong>We’ve started to hire juniors after 3 years.</strong> We paused junior hiring about 3 years ago, and in the summer of 2025, we still had no intern class. But the good news is that we’re targeting to hire 5-6 juniors by 2026, to bring them into a 2-year rotational path, and to get them to mid-level. We’ve started interviewing new grads more, as well.” – Director of Engineering, scaleup, New York.</p><p>“<strong>We tend to fill junior and graduate positions more easily than experienced ones.</strong> There is a larger pool of junior and graduate engineers.” – Director of Engineering, Fintech, London.</p></blockquote><p>Even Amazon seems to be hiring more new grads, according to a Software Developer Manager (SDM) there in Seattle:</p><blockquote><p>“For all the talk about AI replacing entry-level jobs, it feels like the trend is the opposite. We are seeing a large influx of L4s [Amazon’s entry-level role] from good schools. These new grads say most of their friends have got into Meta, Google, or similar places. There are not many left without a job”.</p></blockquote><h3>Pivot to hiring new grads with AI fluency</h3><p>An Engineering Manager in Boston at a publicly traded company said his business is pivoting to onboarding many more junior engineers:</p><blockquote><p>“We’re pivoting to hiring junior and fresh-out-of-college talent. Then, where necessary, we are hiring folks with a focus on highly scalable systems, who come from Big Tech. We’re looking to fill most open roles with very junior talent for different reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Anti anti-AI bias. </strong>We’d never hire an engineer with a whiff of anti-AI bias, these days. Junior engineers are very pro-AI.</p></li><li><p><strong>We convert the best interns to fulltime engineers. </strong>We have a very strict intern hiring approach that is not very forgiving. It has its ups and downs: we get to hire the best of the intern group, but it’s very time-consuming to give thorough feedback for everyone.</p></li><li><p><strong>We don’t need Big Scale folks for many roles. </strong>Being hands-on with AI tools is often more important, so why hire big-scale people?</p></li><li><p><strong>We’re investing in the bottom rung of the ladder.</strong> Junior engineers bring a lot of energy and creativity, and complement senior-heavy teams like our company has historically been.”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>The same place is hiring “AI infra” engineers, the Engineering Manager revealed:</p><blockquote><p>“We are investing in ‘AI infra’ with experienced engineers.<strong> </strong>We’re specifically hiring for AI engineers to embed SRE style to try and raise the benchmark of AI adoption in key areas.</p><p>There’s a lot of teeth gnashing about the death of the junior engineer, but we’re doing the opposite. I agree with the direction, and it seems to be working well, so far.”</p></blockquote><h3>Still tough for juniors – Wellfound</h3><p>Data from Wellfound suggests the market remains challenging for junior profiles. Amit says:</p><blockquote><p>“Junior folks are having a harder time. There are fewer jobs out there, and just a lot more computer science grads on the market compared to years ago. The junior characteristics that get reachouts tend to be:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pedigree</strong>. Profiles from top schools or ‘brand name’ work experience</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical projects</strong>. They have projects which clearly demonstrate they can build production-ready software.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI native.</strong> Profiles that lean into being AI-native and use AI tools better. I know several companies that hire a few really senior people and a bunch of ‘AI-native juniors’ to pair with them”.</p></li></ul></blockquote><h2>3. Picky employers</h2><p>One of the most-mentioned observations is that companies are more selective with their hiring, compared to recent years. For a start, it’s hard to get responses even when candidates <em>reply</em> to inbound messages from recruiters. Here’s a software engineer with 13 years’ experience from Portugal, who recently worked at a crypto startup. He described the experience as “very weird”:</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>90% of the time, I’m ‘ghosted’ when responding to LinkedIn recruiter messages. </strong>When I ask for more details about things like tech stack, location, if the role is remote or hybrid I don’t get any answer 90% of the time!</p><p>This experience is very strange: I never had trouble changing companies in the past, and ‘ghosting’ was not something I’ve experienced before.</p><p>To add insult to injury, when I did get to a first interview, I got rejected. This never happened in past job searches.”</p></blockquote><p>Even for engineers who get lots of inbound messages, securing an offer is tough. A frontend engineer with 25 years of experience, based in California, shares:</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>Hiring managers seem to be looking for the “perfect person”.</strong> I get plenty of inbound from recruiters. However, I still feel that expectations are up and salaries are down. It feels like hiring managers are in a rush to reject and not in a rush to fill positions”.</p></blockquote><p>More observations by candidates:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Companies are more cautious. </strong>They seem to focus on very specific, specialized areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Large companies are not really hiring from startups. </strong>A software engineer in the US with 20 years of experience, and a background of working solely at startups, found very little success with reachouts. Meanwhile, his wife, a software engineer with Big Tech experience, gets far more interviews. A hiring manager said that he was the only candidate in the loop without experience at a large company, which made him feel “like showing up in crocs to a country club.” His conclusion: “I’ve felt like companies are just hoping to grab recently laid-off Big Tech workers at a discount.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Referrals are more important than ever. </strong>Several engineers shared that their current company prioritizes referrals when fast-tracking interviews because these are more trustworthy. Meanwhile, inbound applications are stuffed with keywords, and too many unqualified candidates apply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long interview processes with no feedback are more common. </strong>UK-based software engineer Sam Rose <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samwho.dev/post/3lw4yarbuak2n">shared in this thread</a> how, after 18 hours of interviewing, he received a generic rejection and no feedback, despite going through the full interview loop.</p></li></ul><h3>‘Weaker’ candidates?</h3><p>I asked a hiring manager who’s also looking for a job why he thinks employers are stricter about hiring. They told me they think companies are not harsher, but that candidates aren’t as strong as before:</p><blockquote><p>“Candidates for our senior engineering position have been universally underwhelming. The people I’ve interviewed are either:</p><ul><li><p>Well underqualified for a senior position</p></li><li><p>At a senior level in Big Tech, but an interview reveals massive skill gaps</p></li></ul><p>For example, a fullstack engineer with 10 years at a big-name software company had zero experience with frontend styling systems. All engineering complexity was taken care of by a frontend platform team, or a dedicated infra team. This engineer had no in-depth knowledge of frontend systems or database internals”.</p></blockquote><p>The view that candidates are weaker than before is echoed by several software engineers involved with hiring at their workplaces. <em>Or maybe expectations have gone up!</em></p><h3>Employers like referrals &amp; ignore inbound applications</h3><p>An experienced software engineer in the UK shares:</p><blockquote><p>“Good devs with proven delivery records are approached directly, by recommendation. Lots of offers, many I’m receiving are ‘we will pay what’s necessary to get you’. I spoke with a data company last week where one of my former coworkers works, which is hiring Python devs. They received lots of CVs for inbound applications, but they are not interviewing those applicants.</p><p><strong>In the words of the CEO: many CVs look perfect, but they can’t trust inbound candidates anymore.</strong> They would rather pay more and ‘poach’ someone they previously worked with, than pay market rate and take risks with untrustworthy candidates. So they are pinging the best engineers their team recommends and reaching out, one by one.</p><p>Recruiters working with companies are sending over multiple candidate profiles, but strongly recommend devs they worked with in the past, who they think are strong.</p><p>Trust is now the number one criterion in the UK market.<strong> </strong>For my current job, I was hired after a 15-minute chat about a project, about which I spoke barely a few sentences. This was all at a place where an engineer previously worked with me”.</p></blockquote><p>Personally, I don’t think <em>most</em> companies completely ignore inbound applications, but there is a strong shift towards referrals. Every “fake candidate” caught in the application process will reinforce to hiring managers that they should focus on referrals and sourcing candidates directly.</p><h3>Hiring dynamics during a recruitment freeze</h3><p>An engineering manager at a 4,000-person company in the Netherlands shared how their company has had a hiring freeze for a year.</p><p><strong>The company is listing “ghost jobs” due to internal politics.</strong> The company <em>does</em> have open positions advertised on its website, but these positions do <em>not</em> get approved for external hiring, even after 3 months. In reality, these are “ghost jobs”, and a bottomless pit for applicants.</p><p>This engineering manager described how the hiring freeze affects things:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Poaching from other teams is the new norm. </strong>For ICs who are high performers, there is a lot of politics, and it’s like Game of Thrones to poach from other teams because they can’t hire externally.</p></li><li><p><strong>“Mobbing” up to push out ICs is common.</strong> EMs, Lead devs, and other management use mobbing to push out ICs they dislike. Since ICs are hesitant to look for a new job in the current job market, they look for new jobs internally. Eventually, another team hires them and they switch, meaning the externally-advertised position is filled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Internal poaching is very important for sticking to budgets.</strong> Every team and manager is given a budget which doesn’t leave the company. If you can backfill from another team, the cost of this headcount is added to your cost center. If someone leaves your team and you cannot “poach” to backfill, then your budget will be lower next year. Poaching internally is important for those who want to be within budget by the end of the fiscal year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contractor rates are dropping. </strong>Teams hire contractors (freelancers) as a last resort. There’s less hiring than before, and the pay is slightly lower. Also, contract lengths used to be 12+ months – but now are no longer than 6 months due to budget uncertainty.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Software engineer archetypes in and out of demand</h2><p>Even in the current market, certain types of engineer are <em>incredibly</em> in demand:</p>

I believe in the human potential of people that want to create things. And that’s fundamentally why I love software is that you can create anything that you can imagine.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Interesting learnings from this episode</strong></h3><p>This episode was full of interesting details. Some of my favorite ones:</p><ol><li><p><strong>“Compiles are cool. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”</strong> My favorite quote from Chris. </p></li><li><p><strong>Demonstrate business value inside a large company, first! </strong>Apple hired Chris to work on LLVM, because they were frustrated with GCC. However, it took Chris some friendly advice from his manager, and he “got the vibe that, after a year, if Apple’s not using in some product, then they’ll ask to start doing something else.” This realization pushed Chris to find the first team to be the internal customer to LLVM: which was the OpenGL team, where he was able to “do something very small that actually had value.” After this, more teams inside Apple onboarded to LLVM.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chris built Swift in secret, for more than a year. </strong>For a year and a half, Chris built Swift on nights and weekends, while running a 40+ person (and growing!) team during the day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apple leadership was initially not enthusiastic about Swift, at all, initially. </strong>When Chris showed off an early version of Swift to leadership, the response was “why would we want a new language? Objective C is what made the iPhone successful.”</p></li><li><p><strong>A new programming language for LLMs doesn’t make sense</strong> — according to Chris<strong>. </strong>The readability of a programming language is more important than how easy it is to write it. So in a world with more AI agents writing code, the most powerful languages will be ones that are expressive, and readable. This might be one reason Python remains so popular, and it’s also how Mojo is being designed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Mojo is both so readable, but also so performant:</strong> Mojo took a lot of inspiration from Python for readability, but also added features to make the language be more performant: for example, <a href="http://reducing the precision">compressed floating point formats</a> (the ability to reduce the precision of floating point numbers, by using types like Float16, and using less memory space and do calculations faster with it), and <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> capabilities like <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/metaprogramming">parameters for compile-time calculations.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>How Modular hires new grads:</strong> they look for folks who have intellectual curiosity, are fearless in getting things done, and it’s a positive sign if they’ve contributed to open source projects before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chris’ success is a lot more work and not listening to others than many would imagine. </strong>LLMV, Clang, Swift and other projects Chris created are used industry-wide: but early on, these projects got little support. As Chris put it: “I don’t expect people to understand me. What usually happens is that these projects over time, they grow and they get to the point where suddenly it clicks and suddenly people start to understand.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What Chris is the most proud of: helping others create software. </strong>Something Chris still remembers is how, after Swift became widespread, people stopped him on the street, thanking him that they could become iOS developers using this easier to onboard language.</p></li></ol><h3><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h3><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-in-the-real-world">AI Engineering in the real world</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-ai-engineering-stack">The AI Engineering stack</a></p><p>• <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/uber-app-rewrite-yolo/">Uber’s crazy YOLO app rewrite, from the front seat</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/python-go-rust-typescript-and-ai">Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript and AI with Armin Ronacher</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/microsofts-developer-tools-roots">Microsoft’s developer tools roots</a></p><h3><strong>Timestamps</strong></h3><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=155s">02:35</a>) Compilers in the early 2000s</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=288s">04:48</a>) Why Chris built LLVM</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=504s">08:24</a>) GCC vs. LLVM</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=587s">09:47</a>) LLVM at Apple</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=1165s">19:25</a>) How Chris got support to go open source at Apple</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=1228s">20:28</a>) The story of Swift</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=1472s">24:32</a>) The process for designing a language</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=1860s">31:00</a>) Learnings from launching Swift</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=2148s">35:48</a>) Swift Playgrounds: making coding accessible</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=2423s">40:23</a>) What Swift solved and the technical debt it created</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=2848s">47:28</a>) AI learnings from Google and Tesla</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=3083s">51:23</a>) SiFive: learning about hardware engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=3144s">52:24</a>) Mojo’s origin story</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=3435s">57:15</a>) Modular’s bet on a two-level stack</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=3709s">1:01:49</a>) Compiler shortcomings</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=4151s">1:09:11</a>) Getting started with Mojo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=4544s">1:15:44</a>) How big is Modular, as a company?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=4740s">1:19:00</a>) AI coding tools the Modular team uses</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=4979s">1:22:59</a>) What kind of software engineers Modular hires</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp3131i1yE&amp;t=5122s">1:25:22</a>) A programming language for LLMs?

Pitching to publishers</h2><p>In late 2019, I was an engineering manager at Uber, the ridesharing app. For the first time in my career, I was a manager of managers: suddenly, I had “skip level” software engineers, and it was here that the inspiration came to write a book that provides some advice and observations for these tech professionals.</p><p>During a 1:1 catchup with a new joiner skip-level engineer, they asked about getting up to speed in the workplace faster. They were at the Software Engineer 2 (L4), and wanted to figure out how to get to the Senior engineer level (L5A at Uber). I thought it would’ve been nice to give them a book with a bunch of pointers about what it takes to become an effective software engineer in this environment.</p><p>With that inspiration to write a book about professional growth at large tech companies and startups, I looked for publishers who could help make it a reality. I pitched my book to 3 publishers behind the highest quality tech books in the industry – O’Reilly, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, and Manning. O’Reilly and The Pragmatic Bookshelf passed, but Manning said yes.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":1274,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":null,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":null,"href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":null,"isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="1274" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XgPG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44fce0f0-8ab8-472d-8322-77e254af3005_1712x1498.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Mental model of publishers in 2025.

This is helpful because the published version should not be too long or too short, so this helps set its scope and how topics should be tackled.</p><p>Here is an example of the weighted table of contents for one chapter:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":512,"width":1286,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":null,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":null,"href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":null,"isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="512" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Io6K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d00e830-f480-469c-a390-61def3a5f0be_1286x512.png 1456w" width="1286"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>My weighted table of contents</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>This exercise resembled estimating the size of a piece of work during the planning for a software project, and provided a sense of what the longer and shorter parts of the book would be.</p><h3>Write, write, write</h3><p>The biggest part of writing a book is… writing it. I tried to have some regular cadence of writing, but struggled to get into one. I ended up making progress in bursts, and shared drafts on social media – like <a href="https://x.com/EngGuidebook/status/1541502647248850945?s=20">this one on healthy and unhealthy teams</a>. This generated more ideas and I continued writing.</p><p>It’s easy to get distracted and procrastinate. A 400-page book is too large a project to take on in one go, and sometimes parts of the book change shape: an estimated 4 pages on something can turn into 20 pages a week later. It was like treading water: not making much progress with the book as a whole and being distracted by interesting topics.</p><h3>Starting The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter to finish the book</h3><p>Two years into writing the book, its completion was forever 6 months away. I realized my writing process, with no publisher involved, was inefficient and unfocused.</p><p>In August 2021, I started The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter with the hope that writing a weekly newsletter would speed up completion of the book. My thinking was to send out a draft version of a part of the book as a newsletter every few weeks.</p><p>The idea was sound, but I quickly realized that online newsletter issues can be a lot more in-depth than a chapter in a book can be, due to the issue of space constraints. Also, newsletters are timely by nature (covering what’s happening, <em>right now</em>), whereas a book often covers ideas that remain relevant for years.</p><p>I am thankful to have started The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter, but doing so didn’t hasten the publication of The Software Engineer’s Guidebook. It actually delayed it by another two years.</p><h3>Tools I used for self-publishing</h3><p>There’s many tools available for writing a book, not including new AI tools for generating ideas – or even doing the writing in certain cases. Here’s the tools I chose:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Writing process</strong>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> and <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>. Most of my drafts were in Google Docs, and all my ideas and notes went into Craft.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creating an ebook:</strong> <a href="https://vellum.pub/">Vellum</a>. A one-off purchase, which helps generate e-book and print versions. I didn’t use it for print generation, as the software seems to be optimized for fiction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Print layout</strong>: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>. The PDF layout for print took significant effort, as I wanted to have an index in the end of the book. I ended up hiring a LateX expert who helped create a nice print layout, which would have been challenging for me to do, and time-consuming to learn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reader feedback: </strong><a href="https://betabooks.co/">Betabooks</a>. I wasn’t entirely satisfied as it’s pretty janky to use. In hindsight, sharing drafts in Google Docs and letting readers add comments might have been equally effective.</p></li><li><p><strong>ISBN numbers:</strong> when self publishing, you need to purchase your own ISBN and these depend on your region. <a href="https://www.isbnservices.com/">ISBN Services</a> is a popular choice for the US. I’m residing in the Netherlands, so used the Dutch <a href="https://www.mijnisbn.nl/">Mijn ISBN</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Book cover design</strong>: <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>. Lots of templates to work with, and it’s easy to work with the exact size requirements for print covers, as well. The cover you see today is my wife’s work.</p></li></ul><h3>Publishing platforms</h3><p>I publish my books on these platforms:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Print book</strong>: <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing</a> (KDP) and <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/">Ingram Spark</a>. Amazon covers most countries – but not all; notable gaps include India. Ingram Spark allows libraries and bookshops to order the book. If your title is not expected to be highly popular, Amazon KDP will probably be more than sufficient for print distribution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ebook</strong>: <a href="https://gergelyorosz.gumroad.com/l/engguidebook">Gumroad</a> (to sell the ebook DRM-free), <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon KDP</a>, <a href="https://www.kobo.com/">Kobo Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/">Google Play</a>, and <a href="https://publishdrive.com/">PublishDrive</a>. Publishdrive is a neat service that publishes ebooks and audiobooks to all large and small platforms. In hindsight, I’d probably just use them to publish to all major platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audiobook</strong>: <a href="https://www.voicesbyinaudio.com/">Voices</a> (formerly: Findaway Voices). For some strange reason, Amazon’s audiobook platform (<a href="https://www.acx.com/">ACX</a>) only allows residents of the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, to publish on it. Being a resident in the Netherlands, I had to go with a third-party platform to publish to Amazon. Voices used to be owned by Spotify, and has been spun out into its own company. If I published today, I’d likely just go with PublishDrive for my audiobook, as well.</p></li></ul><p>There’s a long tail of ebook and audiobook platforms, and it makes sense to use an aggregator service that publishes to most, if not all of them, and which then sends a combined payout, instead of lots of small payments from each platform.</p><h3>Don’t forget the launch</h3><p>Going with a publisher has the benefit that they coordinate launch activities, and also list your book on their New Releases pages, which leads to added awareness. Superior publishers also reach out to potential reviewers, and are hands-on in helping with the launch.</p><p>I knew I couldn’t count on launch support, so built a landing page where I collected emails of people who wanted to know when the book was released. To incentivize this, I provided details about the book, and the table of contents.</p><p>In hindsight, this was one of the best things I did: a good chunk of sales at launch came from people who received the email that the book was ready for purchase. Here’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230330200513/https://www.engguidebook.com/">how the book’s website looked, back then.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":849,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":null,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":null,"href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":null,"isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="849" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3EPQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7c2543c-e3e1-4a5a-9713-04b4305252c0_2048x1194.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Landing page for the book, pre-publication</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Another approach that worked well was having a dedicated social media account for the book, where I shared drafts while working on certain chapters.

Just like when working on a big software launch, the best way to make progress is to forget about how many people might use the product, and to just focus on the next task to complete… then the next… then the next.</p><p>It was amusing to remind myself that tech products I’d worked on were used by many times more people than the book could ever hope to reach – so why procrastinate? Plus, mistakes can be fixed with ebooks, they are trivial to do with a re-publish. Of course, this isn’t possible in the same way with print books, but print-on-demand means issues can be resolved in future copies.</p><h2>3. Traveling to Mongolia to meet the startup which translated my book</h2><p>An unexpected highlight of publishing the book was ending up in Mongolia in June of this year, at a small-but-mighty startup called <a href="https://nashatech.com/">Nasha Tech</a>. This was because the startup translated my book into the Mongolian language. Here’s what happened:</p><p>A little over a year ago, a small startup from Mongolia reached out, asking if they could translate the book. I was skeptical it would happen because the unit economics appeared pretty unfavorable. Mongolia’s population is 3.5 million; much smaller than other countries where professional publishers had offered to do a translation (Taiwan: 23M, South Korea: 51M, Germany: 84M people).</p><p>But I agreed to the initiative, and expected to hear nothing back. To my surprise, nine months later the translation was ready, and the startup printed 500 copies on the first run. They invited me to a book signing in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, and soon I was on my way to meet the team, and to understand why a small tech company translated my book!</p><h3>Japanese startup vibes in Mongolia</h3><p>The startup behind the translation is called<a href="https://nashatech.com/"> Nasha Tech</a>; a mix of a startup and a digital agency. Founded in 2018, its main business has been agency work, mainly for companies in Japan.

But why did they do it?</p><p>I was told the idea came from software engineer <a href="https://x.com/ssuuribaatar">Suuribaatar Sainjargal</a>, who bought and enjoyed the English-language version. He <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1937160382600343964?s=20">suggested</a> translating the book so that everyone at the company could read it, not only those fluent in English.</p><p>Nasha Tech actually had some in-house experience of translation. A year earlier, in 2024, the company translated Matt Mochary’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-CEO-Within-Tactical-Building-ebook/dp/B07ZLGQZYC">The Great CEO Within</a> as a way to uplevel their leadership team, and to help the broader Mongolian tech ecosystem.</p><p>Also, the company’s General Manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/battsengel/?originalSubdomain=mn">Batutsengel Davaa</a>, happened to have been involved in translating more than 10 books in a previous role. He took the lead in organizing this work, and here’s how the timelines played out:</p><ul><li><p>Professional translator: 3 months</p></li><li><p>Technical editor revising the draft translation: 1 month</p></li><li><p>Technical editing #2 by a Support Engineer in Japan: 2 months</p></li><li><p>Technical revision: 15 engineers at Nasha Tech revised the book, with a “divide and conquer” approach: 2 months</p></li><li><p>Final edit and print: 1 month</p></li></ul><p>This was a real team effort. Somehow, this startup managed to produce a high-quality translation in around the same time as it took professional book publishers in my part of the world to do the same!</p><p>A secondary goal that Nasha Tech had was to advance the tech ecosystem in Mongolia. There’s understandably high demand for books in the mother tongue; I observed a number of book stands selling these books, and book fairs are also popular. The translation of my book has been selling well, where you can <a href="https://internom.mn/%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B0/9789919053185-%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%84%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%8D%D0%B9%D1%80-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD-%D1%85%D3%A9%D1%82%D3%A9%D1%87-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC">buy the book</a> for 70,000 MNTs (~$19).</p><h3>Book signing and the Mongolian startup scene</h3><p>The book launch event was at Mongolia’s startup hub, called <a href="https://digitalnomad.itpark.mn/">IT Park</a>, which offers space for startups to operate in.

How much did my book earn?</h2><p>There’s usually little information about the key topic of how much authors make from their books being published, beyond “not much”. Author Justin Garrison <a href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2018-05-07-the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book/">shared</a> that his co-authored title <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-infrastructure/9781491984291/">Cloud Native Infrastructure</a> earned $11,554 in its first year – and without three unexpected sponsorships, that amount would’ve been $3.500. Conventional wisdom states you should not write a book for money, but for the other benefits like building your status as an expert in a domain, or exploring a topic in more depth.</p><p>A notable exception to this rule is <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a>, whose author Martin Kleppman made $477,916 in royalties in the first 6 years of publication, as he <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/29/is-book-writing-worth-it.html?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com">shared</a>. Martin published with O’Reilly, and the book sold 108,000 copies, generating around $4.50 per copy in royalties for the author. Still, Designing Data Intensive Applications is one of the most successful books, and Martin argues that a book’s real value lies in the value it creates:</p><blockquote><p>“Writing a book is an activity that creates more value than it captures. What I mean with this is that the benefits that readers get from it are greater than the price they paid for the book. To back this up, let’s try roughly estimating the value created by my book.</p><p>It’s hard to quantify that, but let’s say that the people who applied ideas from the book avoided a bad decision that would have taken them one month of engineering time to rectify. (I’d actually love to claim that the time saving is much higher, but let’s be conservative in our estimates.) Thus, the 10,000 readers who applied the knowledge freed up an estimated 10,000 months, or 833 years, of engineering time to spend on things that are more useful than digging yourself out of a mess.</p><p>If I spend 2.5 years writing a book, and it saves other people 833 years of time in aggregate, that is over 300x leverage. If we assume an average engineering salary on the order of $100k, <strong>that’s $80m of value created</strong>. Readers have spent approximately $4m buying those 100,000 books, so the value created is about 20 times greater than the value captured. And this is based on some very conservative estimates.”</p></blockquote><p>The Software Engineer’s Guidebook will probably be another exception; it has sold 40,000 copies and netted <strong>$611,911</strong> in royalties in the two years since publishing:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

for The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Here is how revenue from different platforms adds up:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Print: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Amazon KDP: 29,806 copies, $470,000 in royalties ($16 per book)</p></li><li><p>Ingram Spark: 1,316, copies, $10,322 in royalties ($8 per book)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Ebooks</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Kindle:

book). 90% of sales came from iTunes, Google Play and Kobo.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Audiobook:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Amazon, Spotify, and other platforms: unclear how many purchases, $6,511 royalties (Audible typically pays around $1.50-3.50 per audiobook, Spotify closer to $9)</p></li><li><p>DRM-free ebook: 241 sales, $3,241 royalties ($13 per book)</p></li><li><p><em>I previously shared more about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/152922587/creating-an-audiobook">how I created the audiobook</a></em></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Translations:</strong></p><ul><li><p>5 languages, $17,000 in upfront royalty payments (South Korea: $5,000, Japan: $4,500, Germany: €3,000, Taiwan: $2,000, China: $2,000)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Total: </strong>$611,911 in royalties, circa 40,000 in copies sold (38,373 copies, plus audiobooks, plus foreign translations that don’t have exact numbers)</p></li></ul><p>These are good numbers for a tech book, and it enjoyed the advantage of being published after The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter found an audience online. <em>Thank you to everyone who purchased a copy of the book or gifted one!</em></p><p>It’s interesting, as someone who self-published print and audiobook versions of their title, that royalties per book sold are highest in paperback, and much lower for the ebook and the audiobook. This is because Amazon takes 70% of the purchase price of the Kindle ebook, and 75% for the audiobook, but only 40% for the print book, in marketplace fees.</p><p>Self-publishing definitely helped substantially increase the royalties generated from the book, which would be 4-8x lower if done via a publisher. At the same time, self publishing increased the amount of time and effort I needed to invest.</p><h2>5. Learnings from writing my book</h2><p><strong>The impact of a book is hard to know with certainty. </strong>When I publish a newsletter article or a podcast episode, the feedback is almost immediate: I get comments, emails, and mentions about the contents for a few days – perhaps a week or two. After that, I rarely hear feedback again.</p><p>But I run into people at events and conferences who say the book helped them focus more on their career, or get a desired promotion to senior-or-above.</p><p><strong>A lot more readers than expected find the book via recommendations or gifting. </strong>I hear stories about my book being recommended or purchased for engineers by managers, or peers, or friends – and <em>then</em> they felt obliged to start to read it. This kind of dynamic also exists with articles and podcast episodes, but my sense is that being given a book is a <em>very</em> strong nudge to invest time in the resource.</p><p><strong>Good books stay valuable for longer – that’s why they’re hard to write. </strong>The final 18 months of writing the book mostly involved editing the existing draft. I tried to remove details that were likely to age poorly in the near to medium term future  – like mentions of specific frameworks, or things that felt like short-lived fads (e.g: “web3” engineering as a category, which seems to have mostly vanished from the discourse.</p><p>Even so, I got burnt by the fast-changing nature of tech. In my last edits, I added short sections on AI, about how it’s a useful tool to learn languages with, or for getting unstuck. I gave examples of tools that were popular in 2023, and predicted they would remain relevant: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Google Bard. I figured that OpenAI would be around for at least 5 years, and that Microsoft and Google know how to name their products.</p><p>I was wrong: Google renamed Bard to Gemini four months after my book was published. In response, I removed all product mentions from an updated version of the book: who knows when the search giant will change the name again!</p><p><strong>Amazon’s print-on-demand service is incredibly good. </strong>Amazon prints books on demand in 10+ markets, and ships these on-demand books to even more countries. Books printed this offer the highest price-per-value across all print-on-demand services I found. Amazon’s KDP is considerably more price efficient compared to the other major print-on-demand player, Ingram Spark.</p><p>One paperback copy of my book (a 413 page book) costs $8 to print with Amazon. With Ingram Spark it’s double this: $16! This is a massive difference in printing costs that is hard to ignore, and is one reason to choose Amazon’s print-on-demand service as primary distribution for print books. <em>This explains why my royalties per book are $16 with Amazon prints, and $8 with Ingram Spark prints.</em></p><p><strong>Ebook, audiobook and print sales reporting feels stuck in the 1990s. </strong>Both ebooks and audiobooks are digital products, so you’d expect it would be possible to get near-real time sales data. But the reality is that it’s not: audiobook platforms like Spotify and Audible release reports monthly (as I understand), and good luck trying to figure out which sales equate to what! This is after Audible takes 80% from sales.</p><p>Ebook reporting is similarly slow, due to sales being reported in a delayed fashion. There are so many audiobook and ebook platforms to buy on that it’s only sensible to use an aggregator like Publishdrive or Voices. This adds one more layer of abstraction and more reporting delays. I understand that print sales take months to be reported, but did not expect it to be the case with audiobooks.</p><p>Even today, I have no idea how to find out how many people have listened to the audiobook, and by now I would have hoped for better reporting. It shows that if there are few suppliers in a segment (like audiobook publishers, who use these reporting tools) and not much competition: companies can get away with poor tooling.</p><p>Print reporting is perhaps even more unusable. Ingram Spark is one of the biggest print-on-demand providers - but it’s not possible to get a report about a sales period longer then a year. The cherry on the cake is how if you query a period longer than 100 days, they can only email these reports:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":718,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":178636,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":"image/png","href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/178614368?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png","isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="718" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPt8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf7eda21-e8c5-494e-ae4a-7b0e0ee39781_1834x904.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Ingram Spark’s reporting interface and functionality feels stuck 10+ years in the past.

It forced me to rewrite and refine my ideas multiple times, and with each rewrite came fresh ideas and a clearer understanding of the subject. This is what really matters for software engineers to progress professionally in the industry, I believe.</p><p>Ultimately, I hope the book generates more “wealth” by helping out devs in a career rut, or who are seeking inspiration to get stronger as engineers. Obviously, commercial success is nice – and I shared those numbers in the spirit of transparency because I believe in the value of detailed, in-depth, and thoroughly researched and written information. Every anecdote helps dispel the myth that books cannot be decent earners for their authors.</p><p>If you’re in the process of writing a book, <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">why not get in touch about doing a guest post</a> in this publication? Personally, I’ve found <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">guest posts</a> tend to be a good fit for engineers midway through writing a book!</p>

Before becoming CTO, Elizabeth led data and insights at Netflix and was VP of Science at Lyft. She brings a rare mix of technical depth, product thinking, and people leadership.</p><p>We discuss what it means to be “unusually responsible” at Netflix, how engineers make decisions without layers of approval, and how the company balances autonomy with guardrails for high-stakes projects like Netflix Live. Elizabeth shares how teams self-reflect and learn from outages and failures, why Netflix doesn’t do formal performance reviews, and what new grads bring to a company known for hiring experienced engineers.</p><p>This episode offers a rare inside look at how Netflix engineers build, learn, and lead at a global scale.</p><div class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs='{"videoId":"sAp9RjO79cU","startTime":null,"endTime":null}' data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM" id="youtube2-sAp9RjO79cU"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="409" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sAp9RjO79cU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" width="728"></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>Interesting details about Netflix</strong></h3><p><strong>A “top” company for engineering talent and retention.</strong> From this report by Signal Fire, Netflix is in the far right corner of this chart, meaning the company hires strong engineering talent, and retention is above industry average:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":900,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":380005,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":"image/png","href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/178618026?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png","isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="900" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M24g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c8ce798-898a-4f0e-accc-56a05108b4d9_1504x930.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.signalfire.com/blog/report-engineering-talent-retention">SignalFire</a></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Hiring of new grads. </strong>Netflix has only hired senior software engineers for the first 25 years of the company — up to 2023, when the company <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thte-scoop-23">introduced engineering levels</a>. Netflix now hires new grads: and because they started from 0% new grad ratio, they have a lot more space to play with. <em>Tech companies hiring more interns and new grads is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/178001705/junior-engineer-hiring-to-rebound">a recent trend we’ve observed.</a></em></p><p><strong>No formal performance review process. </strong>At most tech companies, the annual or bi-annual perf process is heavyweight, and takes away easily a month of focus from engineering managers, and many engineers as well. Netflix doesn’t have a heavyweight process: instead, they put continuous feedback in place, and a few lightweight check-ins, including the <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Keeper Test</a>. They also have an annual 360 review process. This is used as a “safety net,” and sounds like a lightweight feedback process, meant to highlight issues that continuous feedback would not catch.</p><p><strong>Areas where AI tools work well for Netflix</strong> — these are these:</p><ul><li><p>Prototyping</p></li><li><p>Documenting code</p></li><li><p>Working on large migrations</p></li><li><p>Detecting issues (anomaly detection and root cause analysis)</p></li></ul><p>Elizabeth emphasized how they don’t see AI as a “silver bullet:” they experiment with tools, and have observed them to have come a long way in usefulness, from a few years ago.</p><p><strong>Unexpectedly heavy open source investment</strong>. Netflix has won 9 Emmy awards for open source contributions — mostly for video steaming contributions. </p><p>Across all of Big Tech, Netflix has the highest percentage of all engineers contribute to open source: about 20% of them. This was a surprising fact for me to learn, and we went into details in the podcast:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 1456w" type="image/webp"/><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" data-attrs='{"src":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png","srcNoWatermark":null,"fullscreen":null,"imageSize":null,"height":698,"width":1456,"resizeWidth":null,"bytes":427932,"alt":null,"title":null,"type":"image/png","href":null,"belowTheFold":true,"topImage":false,"internalRedirect":"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/178618026?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png","isProcessing":false,"align":null,"offset":false}' height="698" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6pW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c34c729-89f4-4b0f-b714-882c3d38c21c_2074x994.png 1456w" width="1456"/></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">About 1 in 5 engineers at Netflix contribute to open source.

        <h2 class="post-title">Career paths for software engineers at large tech companies</h2>
        <span class="post-date">November 18, 2025</span>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Across tech, the average tenure of software engineers seems to be rising, not least <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/172584839/tenure-rising-fast-at-big-tech">in Big Tech</a> where it has increased rapidly. With today’s chilly job market having a dampening effect on the number of engineers switching jobs, it’s possible that staying in a role for years will become pretty normal for many in our industry.</p><p>So, if you can see yourself at your current workplace for the longer term, it’s sensible to consider the career path options available, and how to get promoted to the next level.</p><p>To shed light on these topics and others, I sought out someone who has managed large engineering orgs at a massive company. <strong><a href="https://www.ethanevans.com/">Ethan Evans</a></strong> is precisely such a person; he was a Vice President of Engineering at Amazon, and has overseen the growth and promotions of more than 1,000 engineers(!) over the course of his career.</p><p>Now recently retired from the online retail giant, Ethan can candidly discuss how large companies operate, and which tactics and strategies <em>really </em>work and help colleagues to enjoy thriving careers in big workplaces.</p><p>These days, Ethan <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans/early-career-promotion-fast-track">teaches</a> engineers and engineering managers how to get promoted faster, and runs <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans">live courses</a>.

In my career as an Amazon VP, I oversaw the growth and promotion of over 1,000 engineers, and saw some grow to senior engineers, and then even on to the Principal or Staff levels. Some people switch to management quickly, while others do this deeper into their careers.</p><p>The “correct” path for you is subjective and depends on your goals and environment. What I will do in this article is give some insights into these paths from a higher perspective, and reveal the choices which leaders make about colleagues and promotions. My goal is to help you choose the right path and navigate it successfully.</p><p>First, some information about the shorthand used at Amazon and Google; this can be applied to other companies on the website, levels.fyi. A mid-level engineer (SDE-2), is level 5, or L5, at those companies. The first level for managers is also L5. Senior engineers (SDE-3s) are L6, as are more experienced small group managers. Principal or Staff Engineers are L7, as are Senior Managers (managers of managers, with 25 to 80 people in their teams).</p><p>It’s easier and shorter to type “L5”, etc., so I’ll use these terms while going through the “three paths” available to a mid-level engineer (L5) who wants to progress. These are:</p><ul><li><p>Grow as an IC, first to L6, then perhaps to L7 and beyond</p></li><li><p>Switch to management early, as an L5</p></li><li><p>Become a senior engineer (L6), then switch to management</p></li></ul><h2>1. Good performance as a mid-level engineer. (L5 at Amazon)</h2><p>When thinking about career paths, we have to begin with what “very good” performance looks like. Until you are seen as a very good L5 engineer, you won’t be thought of as Senior Engineer or manager material. So, from the perspective of the VP level, what makes someone stand out as a good L5 who might be ready for more?</p><p><strong>First, independent execution.</strong> A good L5 can take a reasonable design and just build it. They can figure out some missing details on their own, and don’t need daily or even weekly guidance. They know their craft and can get the work done, while knowing when to raise problems and ask for help.</p><p><strong>Limited complaining.</strong> Leaders might tolerate a high-maintenance engineer for a while, but will never consider a habitual complainer as a candidate for progression. It’s fine to push back on ideas, to ask questions, and to disagree. However, when a decision is made, leaders need people who just go do it – even when they think there’s a better way. Similarly, all jobs have unpleasant sides; for many engineers, this is the Ops part of DevOps: fixing bugs, migrating services, and being oncall. Leaders are going to be reluctant to promote those who only want the “good” work of new design and development. Why? Because <em>all</em> the work needs to be done!</p><p>Before you can move up to L6 or management, it’s necessary to be seen as a valuable, effective member of your team. After all, why would anyone promote someone who doesn’t contribute meaningfully and is hard to work with?</p><p>If you’ve been told you can be difficult, but you nonetheless believe your talent gives you a pass on changing your approach – well, it doesn’t. Remember, your Director or VP has hundreds of engineers on their team and also has a quota for “unregretted attrition”. Placing difficult colleagues in that quota works just fine if they are pains to work with. <em>Note from Gergely: we cover more on Amazon’s <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/49561596/performance-improvement-plan-pip-process">unregretted attrition target</a> and its infamous “PIP culture” in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/49561596/performance-improvement-plan-pip-process">Inside Amazon’s engineering culture</a>.</em></p><h2>2. Traits for a slam-dunk promotion to Senior (L6 at Amazon)</h2><p>Once you are a solid L5, what are the key factors that make a VP see you as an L6 in waiting?</p><p>Even if there are a couple of layers between you and your VP, good executives know their top engineers. I was rarely involved in selecting L5s for potential promotion once I became a VP, but was almost always part of the approval process and was in the room when promotions were discussed, as part of efforts to keep the bar consistent across my whole organization.</p><p>Here are the features of a slam-dunk promotion case from L5 to L6:</p><p><strong>Big ideas that are also </strong><em><strong>right</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Proposing unexpected ideas that work and are valuable to the team’s mission. We expect L6’s to design, contribute to the architecture, and invent things. Showing you can do more than just building what you’re told is the next big step.</p><p><em>An antipattern: </em>endless pet projects that are exciting for the engineer, like learning a new language or tool, but which don’t actually contribute to their team’s needs.</p><p><strong>Significant independent initiative</strong> (the “L6 scope” project). Leaders want to see you can handle a bigger challenge, solo. Can you work with product management, collaborate with them on a design that meets the product goals, and then implement that large design over the course of months of consistent work? Exactly what each company and leader looks for will vary, but usually it’s something like designing, building, and launching a new service with interesting complexity. It can also mean thoroughly refactoring an older, complex service that’s outdated and hard to maintain, but still vital.</p><p><em>Speed tip:</em> it’s often easier to get the chance to take on an ugly refactoring than it is to find some completely new need. It may be quicker to move up by showing your seniority and helpfulness here, than to wait to innovate something “new.”</p><p><strong>Solving problems the leadership didn’t know existed. </strong>A winning recipe for impressing leadership is almost always to spot and address a big problem we didn’t know we had. It shows judgment, initiative, and a desire to help. These are all things we want more of, so they’re rewarded.</p><p><strong>Seeing around corners</strong>: highlighting and solving looming problems currently out of sight to your manager, pointing things out before they become problems, and volunteering to prevent them, is also highly prized.</p><p><strong>Become the “go-to” person: </strong>It stands out to develop unique technical expertise, and be someone whom others on the team refer to; particularly if that includes a higher-level team member. Nothing says “ready for L6” better than a few L6s saying they turn to you on certain matters.</p><p><strong>Mentoring and developing others.</strong> Teams have constant turnover and new hires, and managers can’t mentor new engineers ourselves for lack of time. So, we value those who teach and share skills.</p><p><em>Antipattern:</em> “Don’t bother me, I’m a coder!” Like avoiding oncall and other work, people who are unhelpful by claiming they only focus on development, won’t move up.</p><p><strong>Able to influence – or lead – others</strong>. Often an extension of mentorship; being able to win over others to your ideas, or to direct the efforts of entry-level team members to get something done, is a sign of maturity. Every senior person is expected to be able to organize, direct, and manage complex work beyond their own personal tasks. While managers may do the hiring, firing, performance reviews, etc., it’s necessary for senior ICs to be able to get others to work with them on bigger goals.</p><p><em>Antipattern</em>: being personally difficult to work with is the opposite of bringing people together.</p><p><strong>Operational excellence.</strong> Being the person who doesn’t just take their turn with oncall, but who instead dives in, finds root causes, and builds tools that make the system more reliable. Some engineers avoid operational work, so we value and respect those who willingly do it thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Crisis management. </strong>Being the engineer who jumps on the call when there is a weekend outage, or who volunteers to go onsite with an angry customer. Such engineers show they understand the needs of the business, and that we can count on them when needed most.</p><p><em>Antipattern:</em> absent, blames others, complains.</p><p>You don’t need to do all of these things to become an L6; but the more you do, the better.</p><h2>3. Tactics to get promoted to Senior</h2><p>Given the list of things you can do to be seen as ready for L6, how should you go about it?</p><p><strong>Agree a plan with your manager.</strong> Ideally, discuss it with your manager and agree a course of action. While in theory your manager should be thinking about your development, a wise engineer never leaves this to chance. By talking to your manager, you make your growth goal clear and get the specifics of what they expect. Note that if they have concerns about your current performance as an L5, you are going to need to fix those first.</p><p><strong>Do the work while building a positive relationship.</strong> Many engineers dislike hearing that relationships matter because they believe standards should be objective and that “opinions” shouldn’t matter. Yet, so much depends on “soft judgments”: from who gets the chance to take on new work, to whether or not a project is really big enough to be L6 work. Remember that your manager probably began as an engineer, too. They are just as good as you at arguing why a project is easy and trivial, or complex.</p><p>Some engineers also hear “sucking up” when I mention relationships, but this is not what I mean. A better way to look at it is simply as being pleasant and helpful. Remember, you are probably not the only L5 on the team; a manager is more likely to help those who are helpful and friendly, in the same way as you might help someone you like instead of a person who’s difficult and annoying.</p><p><strong>Be grounded about how long it takes. </strong>Once you and your manager agree a plan, realize that promotion will probably take 1 to 2 years from when you are a solid L5. There are many ways to show you can do well, and while you don’t need to do everything on the list above, you are very unlikely to complete enough of them in less than a year.</p><h3>How to get promoted faster</h3><p>Some people struggle to accept any kind of timeframe. In their minds, the instant they show mastery of some skills, then promotion should follow. But speaking as a leader, it’s not that simple. While you may believe you have shown mastery, from the outside it is often hard to tell if someone is actually good, or just got lucky on the first try. We want to avoid mistakes, so prefer to see a few things delivered in order to be sure that it is skill, not good fortune.</p><p>That said, the way to move as fast as possible is to talk to your manager, have a clear plan, and then start cranking through it. You cannot know when a new person will be hired for you to mentor, or when a big outage will happen. You will progress fastest by being flexible about which elements you demonstrate and by jumping on opportunities as they arise. It’s fine to decline a project if the timing is bad, but then don’t be surprised if your promotion takes longer than the person who grabbed it.</p><h2>4. Getting promoted to Principal or Staff Engineer (from L6 to L7)</h2><p>Now we’ve covered L5 to L6, let’s discuss L6 to L7. The same basics apply: first, be seen as a good, reliable L6 who is solid at that level. Then, share your goal with your manager, get a plan, etc. Below are the key elements of a slam-dunk promotion to Principal / Staff (L7):</p>

Because I mostly know what the properties of wood or concrete or steel are, but I’ve got to go for the worst case.</p><p>We need probably some of that kind of thinking ourselves. </p><p><strong>What are the tolerances of the non-determinism that we have to deal with?</strong> We need to realize that we can’t skate too close to the edge because otherwise we’re going to have some bridges collapsing. And I suspect we’re going to do that, particularly on the security side. </p><p>We’re going to have some noticeable crashes. I fear because people have got skated way too close to the edge in terms of the non-determinism of the tools they’re using.</p></blockquote><p>On how many big companies are “complicated messes,” because of humans.</p><blockquote><p>Martin: “I remember chatting with somebody who had joined an established bank. They joined from a startup and one of their jobs was to modernize the bank.</p><p><strong>Their comment was: ‘now that I’ve been here three years, I think I can </strong><em><strong>understand</strong></em><strong> the problem.</strong> I’ve got some idea of what I can do, what can be done. But it just takes you that long to just really understand where you are in this new landscape because it’s big and it’s been around a long time.’</p><p>Companies are complicated — and often not logical because they are built by humans, not by computers. And there’s all sorts of history in there because all sorts of things happened because so-and-so met so-and-so and had it around with so-and-so, and all of these things kind of percolate over time. And this vendor came in here, and that was popular over here, and then the person who liked this vendor got moved to a different part of the organization. Somebody else came in who wanted a different vendor.</p><p>And all of this stuff builds up over time to a complicated mess. And any big company is going to have that kind of complicated mess<strong>.</strong> It’s very hard to not get that situation.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant

            <p>It’s that time of the year: the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales are on, and the annual festive marketing blitz is just around the corner – or already underway.

Johannes also explains where AI meaningfully helps, where it introduces new failure modes, and why understanding the code you write and ship remains the most reliable defense.</p><p>If you build and ship software, this episode is a practical guide to thinking about code security under real-world engineering constraints.</p><div class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs='{"videoId":"urVf2oNqtXU","startTime":null,"endTime":null}' data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM" id="youtube2-urVf2oNqtXU"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" gesture="media" height="409" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urVf2oNqtXU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" width="728"></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>Interesting quotes from the episode:</strong></h3><p>How code quality and code security are connected:</p><blockquote><p>Gergely: “How does the quality of code relate to security?”</p><p>Johannes: “This is an underrated topic in the industry today. We talked about the null pointer exceptions or these slow regular expressions, right? That can lead to security issues. That’s more of the obvious examples of bugs.</p><p>Think about unreadable code, not well-maintained code: that’s often like spaghetti code. At first, it’s not so obvious how this is connected to security.</p><p>If you think about how code is not easy to comprehend, not easy to review. Then you do pair programming or code reviews in your development team — then in that spaghetti code, you will more likely overlook security problems of your colleague.</p><p>Now, maybe someone found an issue or and issue and reports it back to you. As a developer, you have to fix it. But if it’s not maintainable code, you cannot fix the security problem easily. So quality suddenly becomes a security issue in how the attacker window stays open longer!</p><p><strong>Your code quality is super related to code security, especially now with AI-generated code. </strong>We typically see poor quality of code here. And that becomes a problem for security.”</p></blockquote><p>How AI is introducing new security issues:</p><blockquote><p>Gergely: “How do you think AI is changing code security?”</p><p>Johannes: “We see a change in how code and applications are built. Traditionally, you had this backend/frontend split. In the backend, you had a database. Remove that database, then you don’t have a SQL injection risk anymore.</p><p><strong>As soon as you add an LLM to the backend, you have to deal with prompt injection vulnerabilities.</strong> The attacker can modify the system prompt or manage do some prompt engineering and then mess with the LLM’s logic or the output. It’s taking time both for the attackers to adjust to this, and the industry to adjust in defending against it.”</p><p>Gergely: “What about with coding assistance? Are you seeing things change in terms of how we think about code security?”</p><p>Johannes: “<strong>The big problem [with AI coding assistance] in terms of security is that you produce code much more faster.</strong> Writing code is not the challenge anymore. Suddenly, the new bottleneck is how are you verifying all that code, right? And if you don’t verify it:that leads to security issues or quality issues. Quality issues, on the long run, lead to security problems.”</p></blockquote><p>On software composition analysis:</p><blockquote><p>Gergely: <strong>“What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis">software composition analysis</a> (SCA)?”</strong></p><p>Johannes: “It’s a technique where we look at manifest files and your list of dependencies, depending on the package manager you use. This list of dependencies is checked against a database of known security problems. Those are called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVEs</a>. Then you can - with software composition - map, for example, that this specific Log4j version of your library is vulnerable to the Log4 shell vulnerability that is known. And then it can warn you.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/security-engineering">What is Security Engineering?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-128">Mishandled security vulnerability in </a><a href="http://next.js">Next.js</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-67">Okta Schooled on Its Security Practices</a></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Timestamps</strong></h3><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=151s">02:31</a>) What is penetration testing?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=383s">06:23</a>) Who owns code security: devs or security teams?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=882s">14:42</a>) What is code security?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1030s">17:10</a>) Code security basics for devs</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1295s">21:35</a>) Advanced security challenges</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1476s">24:36</a>) SCA testing</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1526s">25:26</a>) The CVE Program</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1779s">29:39</a>) The State of Code Security report</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=1922s">32:02</a>) Code quality vs security</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2120s">35:20</a>) Dev machines as a security vulnerability</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2249s">37:29</a>) Common security tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2570s">42:50</a>) Dynamic security tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2701s">45:01</a>) AI security reviews: what are the limits?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2871s">47:51</a>) AI-generated code risks</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=2961s">49:21</a>) More code: more vulnerabilities</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=3104s">51:44</a>) AI’s impact on code security</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=3512s">58:32</a>) Common misconceptions of the security industry</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=3785s">1:03:05</a>) When is security “good enough?”</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urVf2oNqtXU&amp;t=3940s">1:05:40</a>) Johannes’s favorite programming language</p><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><p><strong>Where to find Johannes Dahse:</strong></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannes-dahse-112b3057">https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannes-dahse-112b3057</a></p><p><strong>Mentions during the episode:</strong></p><p>• Sonar: <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com">https://www.sonarsource.com</a></p><p>• State of Code Security Report by Sonar <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/the-state-of-code-security-report/">https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/the-state-of-code-security-report/</a></p><p>• OWASP Top Ten: <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten</a></p><p>• Software Composition Analysis: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_composition_analysis</a></p><p>• CVE Program: <a href="https://www.cve.org">https://www.cve.org</a></p><p>• SAST: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing</a></p><p>• What is DAST: <a href="https://github.com/resources/articles/what-is-dast">https://github.com/resources/articles/what-is-dast</a></p><p>• Stack Overflow AI survey: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai">https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai</a></p><p>• Go: <a href="https://go.dev">https://go.dev</a></p><p>• Java: <a href="https://www.java.com">https://www.java.com</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>. </p><p></p>
